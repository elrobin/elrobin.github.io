Research evaluation in Europe: state of the art

    Terttu Luukkonen

Abstract

Although there is no single European way of doing research evaluation, it has been going on since the 1970s, importantly supported by the European Community. Trends include: evaluating socio-economic impacts, commenting on the importance and appropriateness of the evaluated activities, modified peer review, semi-professionalism, and tendering to groups of experts in different countries.
