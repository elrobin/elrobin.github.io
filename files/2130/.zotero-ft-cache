The crucial issue at stake is how this skewness can be related to research
performance. – Citation analysis applied in an evaluative context does not aim at
capturing motives of individuals but rather their consequences at an aggregate
level.

The issue at stake is whether citation analysis can be used in research
evaluation . Therefore, the relationships between citation impact on the one hand,
