Abstract

The dynamic mapping of science using the data in the Science Citation Index was put on the research agenda of science studies by De Solla Price in the mid 1960s. Recently, proponents of ‘co-citation cluster analysis’ have claimed that in principle their methodology makes such mapping possible. The study examines this claim, both methodologically and theoretically, in relation to other means of mapping science. A detailed study of a co-citation map, its core documents' citation patterns and the related journal structures, is presented. At these three levels of possible study of aggregates of citations, an analysis is pursued for the years 1978 to 1984. The many different statistical methods which are in use for the analysis of the respective datamatrices—such as cluster analysis, factor analysis and multidimensional scalling—are assessed with a view to their potential to contribute to a better undérstanding of the dynamics at the different levels in relation to each other. This will lead to some recommendations about methods to use and to avoid when we aim at a comprehensive mapping of science. Although the study is pursued at a formal and analytical level, in the conclusions an attempt is made to reflect on the results in terms of further substantial questions for the study of the dynamics of science.

    As the ABRC-report states “the approach to validation was unashamedly pragmatic: looking to see how well the models/maps worked as ‘reasonable representations’ of the cognitive and social relationships of the fields being studied to the the experts who knew them.” ( Ibid. , P.

    More recently, other researchers clustering journal-journal citations have frankly admitted finding their way in choosing clustering criteria through a ‘trial and error’ method. Cf.: A. J.

    “There is little similarity however between the journal influence maps and co-citation maps because the former are intended primarily to show hierarchies of journal quality, and only secondarily of subject similarity.” ( Op. cit. , note 1 p. 324.)

    Op. cit. , note 25, p. 22: “Of the 1,677,196 pairs that might have been created from 1832 items (the number of possble pairs is 1/2 n(n−1) , where n is the number of documents), only 20 414 appear, i.e. co-citation shows only 1.2% ‘connectedness’ for this set of documents. This is evidence of the looseness of the overall structure.”

    ‘Chaining’ describes the phenomenon where areas of high density are linked together to one supercluster by accidental in-between points. This is a problem specific to single linkage clustering.

    A ‘supercluster’ is defined as the set of all clusters having ‘co-citation links’ with at least one document in the core cluster.
    Op. cit. , note 3, p. 350–352.
    Two core documents were published in Physical Reviews before its split into various sections in 1970. The analysis here has been restricted to Physical Review A , in which nine other core documents have been published. One core document was published in the Proceedings of the Physical Society London. A , which split in 1968 into the various sections of the Journal of Physics . For substantive reasons, we limit the present analysis to the Journal of Physics, B . In the case of the Zeitschrift für Physik and its sections A and B , we took the aggregate of the three citation scores, because here it is more difficult to argue for a further restriction of the analysis.

    Both here and in the factor analysis the Journal of Molecular Spectroscopy shows up as a core ‘chemical physics’ journal. In the qualitative analysis it had mistakenly been included under the category of ‘various physics’.
