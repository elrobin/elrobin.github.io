Title: Retweeting for COVID-19: Consensus building, information sharing, dissent, and lockdown life
Authors: Mike Thelwall , Saheeda Thelwall
(Submitted on 6 Apr 2020)

    Abstract: Public attitudes towards COVID-19 and social distancing are critical in reducing its spread. It is therefore important to understand public reactions, information dissemination and consensus building in all major forms, including on social media. This study analyses the most retweeted posts on Twitter during 20 days in March to give insights into the issues that resonate with the public, and the role Twitter may play in social distancing campaigns. It reports a thematic analysis of English-language tweets March 10-29, 2020, mentioning COVID-19 or coronavirus and with over 100,000 retweets. These were extracted from a collection of 12 million. The main themes identified for the 87 qualifying tweets accounting for 14 million retweets were: lockdown life; attitude towards social restrictions; politics; safety messages; people with COVID-19; support for key workers; work; and COVID-19 facts/news. The results suggest that Twitter played many positive roles, mainly through unofficial tweets. For this, users shared social distancing information, helped build support for social distancing, criticised government responses, expressed support for key workers, and helped each other to cope with social isolation. Nevertheless, a few popular tweets not supporting social distancing show that government messages were not universally successful. Public health campaigns in future may consider encouraging grass roots social web activity to support campaign goals.
