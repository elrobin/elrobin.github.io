Abstract

Web 2.0 technologies are finding their way into academics: specialized social bookmarking services allow researchers to store and share scientific literature online. By bookmarking and tagging articles, academic prosumers generate new information about resources, i.e. usage statistics and content description of scientific journals. Given the lack of global download statistics, the authors propose the application of social bookmarking data to journal evaluation. For a set of 45 physics journals all 13,608 bookmarks from CiteULike, Connotea and BibSonomy to documents published between 2004 and 2008 were analyzed. This article explores bookmarking data in STM and examines in how far it can be used to describe the perception of periodicals by the readership. Four basic indicators are defined, which analyze different aspects of usage: Usage Ratio, Usage Diffusion, Article Usage Intensity and Journal Usage Intensity. Tags are analyzed to describe a reader-specific view on journal content.
Highlights

► The authors propose to apply usage data from social bookmarking services (BibSonomy, CiteULike and Connotea) to evaluate journal readership. ► Due to ongoing problems with local and the lack of global download data, usage statistics based on bookmarks can be an alternative and publisher independent way to analyze reader perception. ► Data acquisition is described for 168,109 scientific articles published in 45 physics journals between 2004 and 2008. ► Journal indicators based on bookmarking data are introduced.

1. Introduction

Informetric studies focusing on scientific journals have recently emphasized the importance of including the readers’ perspectives ( Bollen et al., 2005 , Darmoni et al., 2002 , Gorraiz and Gumpenberger, 2010  and  Rowlands and Nicholas, 2007 ). While citation analysis only captures readers, who publish and thus cite, it fails to measure their influence elsewhere ( Duy and Vaughan, 2006 , Roick, 2006 , Scanlan, 1987  and  Schlögl and Stock, 2004 ). A journals’ content can impact the development of new technology, teaching or everyday worklife, which is not measured by citations.

With the emergence of electronic publishing it became easier to evaluate the influence of periodicals on the whole readership. Click and download data of electronic articles can be analyzed to measure journal perception. Although quite a number of indicators have been introduced, which are based on usage statistics and calculated in analogy to citation measures, data aggregation is still problematic. Despite existing standards like COUNTER (2008) , even local download statistics provided by the publishers are often incomparable and lack consistency ( Baker and Read, 2008  and  Lorenz, 2010 ).

Global usage data are generally wrapped in mystery by the publishers. Attempts have been made to gather global data, but projects like MESUR and by the UK Serials Group compute and compare usage to citation indicators but do not make global usage data available ( Bollen et al., 2008  and  Shepherd, 2007 ). SERUM is a new initiative, which aims to provide access to global usage data and create a Journal Citation Report based on download statistics. However, SERUM is currently nothing more but a “blue sky project”, which still needs to win over publishers and libraries to provide and manage the underlying data set ( Gorraiz & Gumpenberger, 2010 ). Hence, usage statistics based on worldwide article downloads are not available. Due to these problems, alternative, publisher independent ways to measure global readership are needed. The authors propose to estimate global journal usage by analyzing data from social bookmarking services. This contribution reports about a pilot study which explored these new data sources.

As other Web 2.0 technologies like Wikis and Blogs, social bookmarking services are entering the academic world. Designed after Delicious, 1 bookmarking services specialized on STM enable users to store, search and share interesting resources on the Web. Platforms like CiteULike, Connotea and BibSonomy were developed to accommodate the special requirements of academics, i.e. managing bibliographic metadata of scientific literature ( Hammond et al., 2005  and  Reher and Haustein, 2010 ). By bookmarking and tagging articles, academic prosumers generate new information about resources.

Thus, it is proposed to apply social bookmarking data to journal evaluation and examine the extent to which it can be used to describe reader perception. Alt-metrics took a similar approach and emphasized the importance of explore different impact metrics ( Priem and Hemminger, 2010  and  Priem et al., 2010 ). Their ReaderMeter 2 calculates impact indicators for authors based on the number of users who stored their articles in the reference management system Mendeley. 3 In analogy to download and click rates, usage can be indicated by the number of times an article is bookmarked. Compared to a full-text request as measured by conventional usage statistics, which does not necessarily imply that a user read the paper, the barrier to set a bookmark is rather high. Hence, bookmarks might indicate usage even better than downloads, especially if users took the effort to assign keywords. Tags give the users’ perspective on journal content.

Four basic indicators based on social bookmarking data are defined, which are to reflect the different aspects of journal usage measured through bookmarks: Usage Ratio, Usage Diffusion, Article Usage Intensity and Journal Usage Intensity. Since this pilot study focuses on the applicability of bookmarking data to journal evaluation, it is limited to 168,109 documents published in 45 physics journals between 2004 and 2008. In the following, data acquisition and calculation of the indicators for this 45 journals are described.
2. Data and methodology

Today there are four social bookmarking tools serving academic purposes: CiteULike, Connotea, BibSonomy and 2collab ( Reher & Haustein, 2010 ). 4 The latter has been contending with serious server problems and closed registration to new accounts in 2009. Hence, data collection was limited to bibsonomy.org , citeulike.org and connotea.org ( Haustein, Golov, Luckanus, Reher, & Terliesner, 2010 ).

A great share of the metadata of the bookmarking entries proved to be incomplete or erroneous. This often caused an article bookmarked by more than one user not to be recognized as one and the same publication. Thus, not only the social aspect of the bookmarking service is lost, i.e. similar content or users cannot be identified, but also the distribution of bookmarks among journal articles cannot be analyzed correctly. In order to obtain reliable and comparable results on journal usage, the data has to be normalized by journal output. Thus, the bookmarks should be matched on article level.
