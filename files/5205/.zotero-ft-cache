Title: Making sense of global collaboration dynamics: Developing a methodological framework to study (dis)similarities between country disciplinary profiles and choice of collaboration partners 
Authors: Nicolas Robinson-Garcia , Richard Woolley , Rodrigo Costas 
(Submitted on 10 Sep 2019) 
 
    Abstract: This paper presents a novel methodological framework by which the effects of globalization on international collaboration can be studied and understood. Using the cosine similarity of the disciplinary and partner profiles of countries by collaboration types it is possible to analyse the effects of globalization and the costs and benefits of an increasing global networked research system.
