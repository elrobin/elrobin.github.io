Bibliometrics as a Tool for Research Evaluation

Diana Hicks , Georgia Institute of Technology - Main Campus
Julia Melkers , Georgia Institute of Technology - Main Campus
Abstract

Creative use of bibliometric analysis in evaluation offers an unparalleled opportunity to take advantage of the rich information embedded in the written products of scientific work to track the output and influence of funded scholars. Many metrics and techniques have been developed: from publication and citation counts to percentile rankings, h-index, impact factor, maps of the knowledge landscape, maps of geographical distribution, and metrics of interdisciplinarity and specialization. Analysis can demonstrate evolution over long periods of time, and can draw quantitative comparisons among subgroups or with others anywhere in the world. It would be dangerous to consider such data and analysis as “easy” however. Careful attention to detail and method are required to produce robust results.
