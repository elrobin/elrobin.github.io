Abstract

This article outlines the evolution of international scientific production in Spain over the last 25 years, a period characterised by steady growth in research production. The following stages in this process are identified in accordance with some of the factors that predominated at different times. From 1974 to 1982 production increased due to causes endogenous to the scientific system itself, as scientists brought their work into line with the patterns which characterised research in other industrialised countries. From 1982 to 1991 the prioritisation of R&D by government administrative bodies represented a constant stimulus, implemented through a set of legal measures, investments and the creation of posts for new researchers. From 1989 to the present the creation of the Comisión Nacional de Evaluación de la Actividad Investigadora (National Commission for the Evaluation of Research Activity, CNEAI) and the research incentive system have provided a further stimulus, which has led to the maintenance of, and an increase in, the rate of research production in spite of the net decrease in the monetary value of research grants awarded during the last period analysed. Other special characteristics of Spanish research, such as its dependence on the public sector and its essentially academic nature, are discussed.

1. Introduction

During the last 25 years Spain has experienced unprecedented progress in its research capacity, measured in terms of the production of published work. A country in which scientific activity had traditionally been carried out by a minority, where the research infrastructure had been poor, and in which scientific activity had lacked social recognition, has apparently entered a new phase which has placed it, within a very short period, amongst the top ten producers in the scientific world. A remarkable degree of growth is evident when Spain’s scientific position is measured in terms of the gross production of articles recorded in the Science Citation Index (SCI). From 32nd place in the 1963 world ranking, with a total production that represented 0.2% of the world-wide output, Spain had jumped by 1996 to ninth position, with a publication output that accounted for almost 2.5% of the total world production. In other words, Spain’s proportional contribution increased more than tenfold.

These data, which correspond to the period from 1974 to 1997, accurately reflect the exponential distribution described by Price in his well-known study of scientific growth ( Price, 1973 ). According to this author, such growth corresponds to the initial stages of the scientific process which, in the long run, tends to decelerate to logistic rather than logarithmic growth. Nevertheless, these growth processes take place within the context of what can be called ‘free growth’. In the SCI, growth is limited by the inherent dimensions of the total population of published articles, which obviously does not grow indefinitely. This means that any growth which is faster than the baseline rate can only take place at the expense of other producers. This leads to the conclusion that, above a certain point, it becomes increasingly difficult to scale positions in the ranking. These circumstances, however, do not appear to have affected Spanish research production so far, and it is this factor which has aroused the interest of several authors ( Kovach, 1978 , Anderson, 1986 , Garfield, 1994 , Garfield, 1995  and  Garfield, 1998 ). This unusual rate of growth has also attracted the attention of journals such as Nature , which recently devoted an entire supplement to Spanish science (Nature, 1998). This scientific position is particularly outstanding in that surpasses Spain’s position in 1996 in 12th place relative to other European countries according to Gross National Product (GNP). At that time Spain’s GNP accounted for only 1.86% of the world total production ( European Commission, 1997 ). This rapid growth in research output has been well documented in many articles, most published in the mid-1980s. Nevertheless, most of these reports referred to limited temporal settings ( Lopez-Pinero et al., 1984 , Mendez and Gomez, 1986 , Terrada and Lopez-Pinero, 1990 , Maltras and Quintanilla, 1992 , Maltras et al., 1995  and  Gomez et al., 1997a ) and to specific fields of knowledge, scientific disciplines or specialities ( Vazquez, 1986 , Mendez et al., 1987 , Ferreiro Alaez et al., 1989 , Guardiola and Cami, 1989 , Gomez et al., 1990 , Pestana, 1992 , Cano and Julian, 1992 , Bordons and Barrigon, 1992 , Bordons et al., 1992 , Cami et al., 1993 , Guardiola and Banos, 1993 , Gomez et al., 1995 , Rodriguez and Moreiro, 1996 , Soriguer Escofet et al., 1996 , Bordons et al., 1996 , Lopez-Munoz et al., 1996  and  Mendez and Gomez, 1985 ). Other studies centred on a single institution ( Mendez and Gomez, 1985 , Perez-Alverez Ossorio et al., 1994 , Perez-Alverez Ossorio et al., 1991 , Gomez Leal, 1993 , Jimenez-Contreras, 1997 , Bellavista et al., 1993 , Pulgarin et al., 1992  and  Sanchez Ayuso, 1999 ). This list could be extended even further to include comparative studies of different countries (including Spain) or global analyses of scientific activity, but it seems appropriate draw the limit at work which refers exclusively to Spain.

Although none of this research has outlined the process from a global perspective and within a wider timeframe (specifically the last 25 years), the majority of these studies identified a number of factors that might help explain this evolution. Most of them attributed this progress to the increase in R&D investment and the application of an evaluation policy aimed at stimulating scientific production and its international diffusion. Some of this research has analysed the effects of these government measures as independent factors responsible for the progress in Spain’s science productivity ( Ricoy, 1990 , Dorado et al., 1991 , Gonzalez Blasco, 1992 , Marin Leon, 1993 , Sanz Menendez, 1995 , Rey et al., 1998  and  Millan Barbany, 1998 ).

Nevertheless, the present article proposes that this phenomenon has still not been adequately explained, in that previous work failed to accurately determine the importance of each of these factors. Specifically, insufficient attention has been given to the importance of the establishment, for the first time in Spain, of an evaluation policy administered by the Comisión Nacional de Evaluación de la Actividad Investigadora (National Commission for the Evaluation of Research Activity, CNEAI), whose activities have been the subject in recent years of controversy within Spanish universities and public research organisations. This controversy has been reflected in articles in the national press and items on national television news broadcasts.

The general approach of the CNEAI falls within the Mertonian scheme of scientific functioning, according to which one of the main driving forces behind scientists’ academic behaviour is the motivation to achieve recognition by one’s peers. According to some authors, this approach not only explains scientists’ academic behaviour, but also foments the general coherence and functioning of the system from an economic perspective. In other words, this approach ensures, although with certain limitations, that scientific progress is advantageous for society as a whole, and at the same time is economically viable ( Dasgupta and David, 1994 ).
