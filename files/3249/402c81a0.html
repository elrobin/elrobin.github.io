has been expected to produce 'reliable' knowledge, provided merely
that it communicates its discoveries to society. A new contract must now ensure
that scientific knowledge is 'socially robust', and that its production
is seen by society to be both transparent and participative.</p></div><div id="articlebody"><p class="norm">Modern science has until recently flourished partly because of a stable,
underlying agreement between its practitioners and the rest of society. In
other words, there has been a social contract between science and society,
an arrangement built on trust which sets out the expectations of the one held
by the other, and which — in principle — includes appropriate
sanctions if these expectations are not met.</p><p class="norm">This social contract has been made up of several individual elements, reflecting
broader contracts between government and society, between industry and society,
and between higher education and society. The contract between university
science and society, for example, has been based traditionally on the understanding
that universities will provide research and teaching in return for public
funding and a relatively high degree of institutional autonomy; under this
contract, the universities, often supported through research-funding agencies,
have been expected to generate fundamental knowledge for society, and to train
the highly qualified manpower required by an advanced industrial society.
</p><div id="illus1" class="image-legend"><img alt="Science's new social contract with society" src="402c81aa.0.jpg"><p>AP</p><p>Traditional boundaries between university and industrial science, and between
basic and applied research, are disappearing. As a result, science and society
are invading each other's domain, requiring a rethinking of previous responsibilities.
</p></div><p class="norm">By contrast, the contract with industrial research
and development (R&amp;D) has been based on an understanding that industry
would provide for the appliance of science through the work of its laboratories,
and thus carry the discoveries of basic science into product and process innovations.
In turn, government science was meant to use research establishments to fill
the gap between university science and industrial R&amp;D. The understanding
has been that the state has been directly responsible for carrying out research
related to national need; for example, in defence, energy, public health and
standards.</p><p class="norm">For most of the twentieth century, universities, government research establishments
and industrial laboratories have therefore operated relatively independently,
developing their own research practices and modes of behaviour. Recently,
however, this relative institutional impermeability has gradually become more
porous. Privatization policies, for example, have moved many government research
establishments into the market place. With the relaxation of the Cold War,
governments have shifted their priorities from security and military objectives
to maintaining international competitiveness and enhancing the quality of
life. And many long-established industries have been denationalized, while
in many countries companies previously dependent upon government for R&amp;D
support through military technology projects have had to find these resources
elsewhere, or in partnership with others, to compete in international markets.
</p><p class="norm">Meanwhile the expansion of higher education has been accompanied by a culture
of accountability that has impacted on both teaching and research. In research,
many academics have had to accept objective-driven research programmes, whereas
research funding agencies have been increasingly transformed from primarily
responsive institutions, responsible for maintaining basic science in the
universities, into instruments for attaining national technological, economic
and social priorities through the funding of research projects and programmes.
</p><p class="norm">These trends can be observed internationally, even if their precise form
and timing has varied between countries. Cumulatively, they signal the end
of the institutional arrangements through which science flourished during
and after the Second World War, and thus mark the expiry of the social contract
between science and society that has dominated this period. A new social contract
is now required. This cannot be achieved merely by patching up the existing
framework. A fresh approach — virtually a complete 'rethinking'
of science's relationship with the rest of society — is needed.</p><h4 class="norm">Reflecting complexity and diversity</h4><p class="norm">One aspect of this new contract is that it needs to reflect the increasing
complexity of modern society. For example, there are no longer clear demarcation
lines between university science and industrial science, between basic research,
applied research and product development, or even between careers in the academic
world and in industry. There is now greater movement across institutional
boundaries, a blurring of professional identities and a greater diversity
of career patterns.</p><p class="norm">But the price of this increased complexity is a pervasive uncertainty.
One way of looking at this is in terms of an erosion of society's stable categorizations,
namely the state, market, culture and science. Alternatively, it can be seen
as the cumulative effect of parallel evolutionary processes. For there has
been a co-evolution in both society and science in terms of the range of organizations
with which researchers are prepared to work, the colleagues with whom they
collaborate, and topics considered interesting. Whatever viewpoint one takes,
science is now produced in more open systems of knowledge production.</p><p class="norm">One consequence is that the norms and practices of research in university
and industrial laboratories have converged. There are still differences between
universities and industry, but these do not impact on what is considered sound
scientific practice<sup><a href="#B1">1</a></sup>. Indeed, science and society more generally
have each invaded the other's domain, and the lines demarcating the one from
the other have virtually disappeared.</p><p class="norm">As a result, not only can science speak to society, as it has done so successfully
over the past two centuries, but society can now 'speak back'
to science. The current contract between science and society was not only
premised on a degree of separation between the two, but also assumed that
the most important communication was from science to society. Science was
seen as the fountainhead of all new knowledge and, as part of the contract,
was expected to communicate its discoveries to society. Society in turn did
what it could to absorb the message and through other institutions —
primarily industry — to transform the results of science into new products
and processes.</p><p class="norm">Science was highly successful working in this mode, and for as long as
it delivered the goods, its autonomy was seldom contested. Yet this success
has ironically itself been instrumental in changing its relationship with
society, drawing science into a larger and a more diverse range of problem
areas, many lying outside traditional disciplinary boundaries. It is this
increasingly intense involvement of science in society over the past half
a century that has created the conditions that underpin the growing complexity
and the pervasive uncertainty in which we live, and encouraged the social
and behavioural experiments described above.</p><p class="norm">But if it is widely recognized that science is transforming modern society,
it is less often appreciated that society, in speaking back, is transforming
science. I will use the term 'contextualization' to describe this
process, and 'contextualized knowledge' as the outcome of this
reverse communication. Contextualization affects modern science in its organization,
division of labour and day-to-day practices, and also in its epistemological
core.</p><p class="norm">In relation to the former, for example, research carried out in both industrial
and government laboratories, as well as the funding policies of research-funding
agencies, have opened up to a wide range of socioeconomic demands, admitting
more and more cross-institutional links, and thus altering the balance between
the different sources of funding of academic research. Thus in 'speaking
back' to science, society is demanding various innovations, for example
the pursuit of national objectives, the contribution to new regulatory regimes
and acknowledgement of the multiplication of user–producer interfaces.
</p><p class="norm">In relation to the latter, the epistemological dimension, the increasing
importance of 'context' is also reflected in a relatively rapid
shift within science from the search for 'truth' to the more pragmatic
aim of providing a provisional understanding of the empirical world that 'works'<sup><a href="#B2">2</a></sup>. John Ziman, former physicist and long-time contributor to social
studies of science, has described science as a form of 'reliable knowledge'
that becomes established not in terms of an abstract notion of objectivity
but, concretely, in terms of the replicability of research statements and
the formation of a consensus within the relevant peer group<sup><a href="#B3">3</a></sup>.
Reliable knowledge is therefore defined as such because it 'works'.
</p><p class="norm">But what 'works' has now acquired a further dimension that
can best be described as a shift from 'reliable knowledge' to
what Nowotny <i>et al</i>. call 'socially robust' knowledge<sup><a href="#B4">4</a></sup>. The latter characterization is intended to embrace the process
of contextualization. For 'socially robust' knowledge has three
aspects. First, it is valid not only inside but also outside the laboratory.
Second, this validity is achieved through involving an extended group of experts,
including lay 'experts'. And third, because 'society'
has participated in its genesis, such knowledge is less likely to be contested
than that which is merely 'reliable'.</p><h4 class="norm">Socially robust knowledge</h4><p class="norm">My argument is that we are currently witnessing a significant shift from
'reliable' to 'socially robust' knowledge. Three observations
can immediately be made. The first is that the basic conditions and processes
that have underpinned the production of 'reliable knowledge' are
not necessarily compromised by the shift to 'socially robust knowledge'.
Indeed, if these conditions and processes have been undermined, it may have
been as much by the narrow outlook of much scientific practice as by any attempt
to widen the range of stakeholders, or more systematically to take into account
the context in which science is produced.</p><p class="norm">The second observation is that reliable knowledge has always only been
reliable within boundaries. Science was recognized as inherently incomplete
because it is, primarily, a method rather than a final answer. But to achieve
a reasonable degree of reliability, the problem terrain had also to be circumscribed,
and judgements on what is included there restricted to those of a peer group,
rather than opened to the scientific community as a whole.</p><div id="illus2" class="image-legend"><img alt="Science's new social contract with society" src="402c81ab.0.jpg"><p>GREENPEACE</p><p>Both pressure groups and ordinary consumers are demanding that the debate
surrounding the health implications of GMOs be broadened to include the perspectives
of the non-expert community.</p></div><p class="norm">Both aspects of reliable knowledge are carried forward into socially robust
knowledge. But although knowledge remains incomplete, this is no longer only
in the conventional sense that it will eventually be superseded by superior
science; rather it means that it may be sharply contested, and no longer remains
within the controlled environment of scientific peers. This shift involves
renegotiating and reinterpreting boundaries that have been dramatically extended,
so that science can no longer not be validated as reliable by conventional
discipline-bound norms; while remaining robust, science must now be sensitive
to a much wider range of social implications.</p><p class="norm">An example is the current debate surrounding genetically
modified organisms (GMOs). Here, specialist peer groups have been challenged
not only by pressure groups but also by ordinary consumers, for whom the research
process is far from transparent, and who are demanding that it be more so.
Here, knowledge of the health implications of GMOs may be 'reliable'
in the conventional scientific sense; but it is not socially robust, and will
not become so until the peer group is broadened to take into account the perspectives
and concerns of a much wider section of the community.</p><div id="illus3" class="image-legend"><img alt="Science's new social contract with society" src="402c81ac.0.jpg"><p>US DEPT OF ENERGY</p><p>A failure to persuade the broad public of the value of the US Superconducting
Super Collider research programme may have contributed to the collapse of
funding for the project.</p></div><p class="norm">There was also a degree of contestation in the United
States about the value of the Superconducting Super Collider (SSC), plans
for which were dropped in 1992. In this case, however, unlike the case with
GMOs, there was no spontaneous backlash from society generally about the value
of the knowledge. Rather, it has been argued that the collapse of funding
for the project was a result of the unwillingness (or inability) of a narrow
disciplinary group to extend its boundaries sufficiently to persuade other
scientists and politicians that the research would be of wide benefit<sup><a href="#B5">5</a></sup>. Again we see a failure to achieve sufficient social robustness
in the research process, however reliable it may be in its own terms.</p><p class="norm">The third observation is that the epistemological core of science has,
over time, become crowded with norms and practices that cannot be reduced
easily to a single generic methodology, or, more broadly, to privileged cultures
of scientific inquiry. There is no one set of practices that describe, much
less lead to, good science. The case for science can still be made in essentially
functionalist terms; but many more factors now need to be taken into account
before a solution that 'works' can be adopted.</p><p class="norm">One outcome of all these changes is that the sites at which problems are
formulated and negotiated have moved from their previous institutional locations
in government, industry and universities into the 'agora' –
the public space in which both 'science meets the public', and
the public 'speaks back' to science. This is a space in which
the media is increasingly active, and in which the new communication technologies
play a prominent role. It is also the domain in which contextualization occurs.
Neither state nor market, neither exclusively private nor exclusively public,
the agora is where today's societal and scientific problems are framed and
defined, and their 'solutions' are negotiated.</p><h4 class="norm">Narratives of expertise</h4><p class="norm">The factor that has come to the fore in the agora is the role of scientific
and technical expertise that is so crucial to decision making in highly industrialized
societies. This role is changing as expertise spreads throughout society,
resulting in the fragmentation of established links between expertise and
institutional structures, whether of government, industry or the professions.
Furthermore, the questions asked of experts are neither the same, nor simple
extensions of, the ones that arise in their specialist fields of study. Experts
must now extend their knowledge to widely disparate areas, and try to integrate
what they 'know' now with what others want to 'do'
in the future.</p><p class="norm">Collective narratives of expertise need to be constructed to deal with
the complexity and the uncertainty generated by this fragmentation. Such narratives
are challenging to their participants. Experts must respond to issues and
questions that are never merely scientific and technical, and must address
audiences that never consist only of other experts. The limits of competence
of the individual expert call for the involvement of a wide base of expertise
that has to be carefully orchestrated if it is to speak in unison.</p><p class="norm">Since expertise now has to bring together knowledge that is itself distributed,
contextualized and heterogeneous, it cannot arise at one specific site, or
out of the views of one scientific discipline or group of highly respected
researchers. Rather it must emerge from bringing together the many different
'knowledge dimensions' involved. Its authority depends on the
way in which such a collective group is linked, often in a self-organized
way. Breakdowns in social authority arise when links are inadequately established,
as has occurred in European debates over GMOs.</p><h4 class="norm">Rethinking science</h4><p class="norm">These four inter-related processes — co-evolution, contextualization,
the production of socially robust knowledge and the construction of narratives
of expertise — form a framework both for rethinking science and for
understanding any new social contract between society and science. Co-evolution
denotes an open interaction between science and society which generates variety
through experimentation, whether in scientific problems, colleagues or institutional
designs, with the selective retention of certain choices, modes or solutions.
This is so even while these experimental approaches, in responding to uncertainty
and complexity, not only promote permeability but also generate more complexity
and uncertainty, thus encouraging further experimentation.</p><p class="norm">Greater permeability provides the basis for increased contextualization
by increasing the routes through which society can 'speak back'
to science. Denser communication itself brings an imperative to produce socially
robust knowledge that is seen as valid not only inside but also outside the
walls of the laboratory, in terms of being accepted as legitimate.</p><p class="norm">As the walls of laboratories have opened up, more and more scientists have
taken their places as actors in the agora, broadening the range of experts
whose view might be sought on a particular problem or issue. To cope with
this, a further development in the use of scientific and technical experts
is needed. For reliable knowledge can only become socially robust if society
sees the process of knowledge production as transparent and participative.
The old image of science working autonomously will no longer suffice. Rather,
a reciprocity is required in which not only does the public understand how
science works but, equally, science understands how its publics work.</p><p class="norm">The process of rethinking science, now that the line that used to separate
science and society has virtually disappeared, has scarcely begun<sup><a href="#B5">5</a></sup>.
But several changes in perspective must be initiated before a new social contract
can emerge. First, the need for contextualization means that the (unknowable)
implications as well as the (planned or predictable) applications of scientific
research have to be embraced.</p><p class="norm">Research activities now transcend the immediate context of application,
and begin to reach out, anticipate and engage reflexively with those further
entanglements, consequences and impacts that it generates. This 'context
of implication' always transcends the immediate 'context of application'
in which it occurs. It may embrace neighbouring research fields, and as yet
obscurely recognized future uses. Taking the 'context of implication'
seriously opens the door to those previously excluded from decisions about
research. The individuals now involved may be encountered haphazardly as individuals,
perhaps colleagues or rivals. They may come from other scientific disciplines,
or from the 'user' community. Whatever their origins, scientific
knowledge will increasingly need to be tested not only against nature, but
against (and hopefully also with) other people.</p><p class="norm">Furthermore, while it is important to define problems, and then assemble
the intellectual, human and financial resources needed to solve them, this
is not, in itself, sufficient to guarantee the reflexivity characteristic
of socially distributed knowledge production. In contrast, a process of contextualization
that attempts to embrace unpredictable and unintended implications demands
reflexivity, as it is intended to incorporate future potential implications
into the research process from the very beginning. It thus goes far beyond
a conventional 'forward look' or 'technology foresight'
exercise.</p><p class="norm">This has several consequences. One is the need for strategies to 'fix'
more accurately the implications of knowledge production. This might be done
by identifying areas in which significant implications of particular research
projects are likely to arise without being pinpointed exactly, making it necessary
to 'prospect' for these (presently unknowable) implications. Such
a process might, for example, involve consulting other knowledge producers
and users, as well as wider social constituencies, in order to carry out a
form of 'triangulation' survey. Perhaps every research proposal
and project should include a deliberate strategy for identifying its 'context
of implication'. This might best be achieved by including those likely
to be implicated — perhaps unknowingly — as well as the conscious
carriers of social knowledge.</p><p class="norm">A second need is for the process of contextualization to be internalized.
The 'context of application' can be managed through 'external'
mechanisms such as 'forward look' and 'technology foresight'
exercises, and through science and technology parks and technology transfer
or industrial liaison offices within universities. In contrast, the 'context
of implication' needs to be internalized by researchers if it is to
be effective. It is expressed through routes, often informal, that cannot
easily be incorporated into administrative procedures. These new lines of
communication need to be encouraged and recognized institutionally. This cannot
be done by communications experts — contextualization is not a public
relations exercise — or by asking journalists to develop popular accounts
of the significance of research.</p><p class="norm">A further important point is that the more open and comprehensive the scientific
community, the more socially robust will be the knowledge it produces. This
is contrary to the traditional assumption that there is a strong relationship
between the social and intellectual coherence (and, therefore, the boundedness)
of a scientific community, and the reliability of the knowledge it produces.
Reliable knowledge may have been best produced by such cohesive (and therefore
restricted) scientific communities. But socially robust knowledge can only
be produced by much more sprawling socio/scientific constituencies with open
frontiers.</p><p class="norm">At the same time, socially robust knowledge is superior to reliable knowledge
both because it has been subject to more intensive testing and retesting in
many more contexts — which is why it is 'robust' —
and also because of its malleability and connective capability. Its context
is not predetermined or fixed, but open to ceaseless renegotiation. Instead
of achieving a precarious invariance by establishing strict limits within
which its truthfulness can be tested, as reliable knowledge does, socially
robust knowledge is the product of an intensive (and continuous) interaction
between data and other results, between people and environments, between applications
and implications.</p><p class="norm">It is also clear that science must leave the ivory tower and enter the
agora. To increase the effectiveness with which the agora operates, the self-organizing
capacity of all participants needs to be enhanced. Here, there is tension
between the desire for individual or institutional autonomy and the increasing
demands for accountability on both individuals and institutions.</p><p class="norm">Increasing the capacity for self-organizing means that participants need
to act more reflexively. But one cannot enhance responsiveness by simply increasing
the demand for public accountability, as this could make participants more,
rather than less, defensive. On the contrary, what is needed is to encourage
participants voluntarily to internalize accountability. Indeed there is an
analogy between the relationships between autonomy and self-organization on
the one hand, and between reliable and socially robust knowledge on the other.
In the agora, the conditions that promote greater self-organization also promote
the generation of socially robust knowledge.</p><h4 class="norm">Conclusion</h4><p class="norm">To summarize, I have argued in this paper that the prevailing contract
between science and society was set up to sustain the production of 'reliable
knowledge'; a new one must ensure the production of 'socially
robust knowledge'. The prevailing contract is governed by the rules
of bureaucratic rationality, with society linked to 'people' primarily
through representative institutions. A new contract will require more open,
socially distributed, self-organizing systems of knowledge production that
generate their own accountability and audit systems. Under the prevailing
contract, science was left to make discoveries and then make them available
to society. A new contract will be based upon the joint production of knowledge
by society and science.</p><p class="norm">A new social contract will therefore involve a dynamic process in which
the authority of science will need to be legitimated again and again. To maintain
this, science must enter the agora and participate fully in the production
of socially robust knowledge. According to some observers, we can already
see this approach emerging in the management of large technology projects.
Thomas P. Hughes, the eminent American historian of technology, has identified
a new ethos among engineers who now recognize that the deeper involvement
of communities in decision making actually produced better engineering solutions
in a number of projects<sup><a href="#B6">6</a></sup>. If the boundaries between science,
technology and society are becoming more permeable, why should not a similar
approach in science likewise produce more socially robust solutions?</p></div><p class="norm"></p><div id="References"><a href="#top" class="backtotop">Top<span class="hidden"> of page</span></a><h3 class="sectitle1">References</h3><ol class="norm"><li id="B1"><a name="B1"><!-- . --></a>van Duinen, R.
