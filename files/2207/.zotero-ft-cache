Abstract

A review of selected parameters of the growth of scientific collaboration over the last century provides further confirmation of the dependency of teamwork on the increasing professionalization of science. Analysis reveals significant inaccuracies in current views of the recency and prevalence of collaborative research, and affords a more correct picture of twentieth century developments. A change in the growth rate of the practice of scientific collaboration at about the time of World War I, and indications of associations of teamwork with financial support and research publication in leading journals are discussed. Characteristics of the natural history of scientific collaboration signify that collaboration reflects relationships of dependency within a hierarchically stratified professional community, and serves as a means of professional mobility. As such, it continues to fulfil its original functions.

    The percentage displayed by Zeitschrift may reflect either the shift of center of gravity of research to the U.S., or the possibility it isn't a core journal. Absent from these statistics are French journals, which we have not examined. Our theory, however, would lead us to predict that the relatively depressed state of science in France “in the age of the scientific state” would result in its best journals exhibiting a below average frequency of teamwork.

    For this figure, we are aware that the conflation of statistics from different sources represents a potential methodological difficulty, but are convinced that whatever degree of mismatching may exist is trivial. We have tried different weightings of the abstracting literature statistics, with virtually indistinguishable results. What is particularly interesting is the possibility that these data depict a logistic curve, already abundantly testified to in studies of the science of science; if so, the growth of collaboration is rapidly approaching its saturation limit.

    The relative insulation of the U.S. from the locations of combat masks the effect for the abstracting journals particularly for World War I; the effect is most pronounced for the European journals counted directly.

    In Table 3, journals are arranged by subjects according to the list headings in the 1970 Guide to the Science Citation Index published by the Institute for Scientific Information, Philadelphia, Pa. The number of authors in every journal is taken from a printout of the 1970 Science Citation Index Tapes, which contains statistics of the number of articles published in the source journals processed in the SCI . It is to be noted that the count has been edited; anonymous articles have been subtracted from the total number of articles in the journal and do not affect the average. For permission to publish this table, grateful acknowledgement is due to the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI), and to Prof. D. deS. PRICE of Yale University, who first utilized this table, and kindly made it available to us. For further information about SCI, see E. GARFIELD, Science Citation Index, a New Concept in Indexing, Science , 144 (1964) 649–654.
