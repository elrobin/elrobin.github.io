Abstract

We examine the extent to which different types of substantive project contributions as well as social factors predict whether a scientist is named as author on a paper and inventor on a patent resulting from the same project. Using unique survey data from over 2000 life scientists, we find that the predictors of authorship differ from those of inventorship. A wider range of project contributions may result in authorship, and social factors appear to play a larger role in authorship decisions than in inventorship decisions. We also find evidence that project contributions and social factors interact in predicting authorship, suggesting that the two sets of factors should be considered jointly rather than seen as independent determinants of attribution. In addition to providing novel insights into the functioning of the authorship and inventorship system, our results have important implications for administrators, managers, and policy makers, as well as for innovation scholars who often rely on patents and publications as measures of scientists’ performance.
Highlights

► We examine the degree to which different types of project contributions and social factors predict authorship and inventorship attribution. ► We use survey data from over 2000 life scientists. ► Authorship and inventorship strongly reflect conceptual contributions. Authorship can also reflect contributions of material/data or technical work. ► Hierarchical status predicts inventorship, prior scientific accomplishments matter for authorship. ► We discuss implications for scientists and policy makers, as well as for innovation scholars who often rely on patents and publications as measures of performance.
