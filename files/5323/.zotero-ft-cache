Title: Indicators of Open Access for universities 
Authors: Nicolas Robinson-Garcia , Rodrigo Costas , Thed N. van Leeuwen 
(Submitted on 10 Jun 2019 ( v1 ), last revised 8 Oct 2019 (this version, v2)) 
 
    Abstract: This paper presents a first attempt to analyse Open Access integration at the institutional level. For this, we combine information from Unpaywall and the Leiden Ranking to offer basic OA indicators for universities. We calculate the overall number of Open Access publications for 930 universities worldwide. OA indicators are also disaggregated by green, gold and hybrid Open Access. We then explore differences between and within countries and offer a general ranking of universities based on the proportion of their output which is openly accessible.
