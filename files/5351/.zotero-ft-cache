Abstract 
 
An anecdotal introduction of the role of operational definitions in representing uncertainty is followed by a brief history of operational definitions, with particular attention to the foundations of probability and the fuzzy representations of uncertainty. A short summary of experience at the TU Delft points to relevant open questions. These in turn are illustrated by a recent application to NO x emissions in The Netherlands.
