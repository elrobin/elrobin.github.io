Abstract
We believe that support for academic clinical research has greatly declined in recent decades. Here we discuss our views on why this has happened. We define clinical or patient-oriented research as limited to the study of human beings or populations of individuals, and argue that its eclipse in favor of basic and "translational" research is the result of inappropriate conceptual paradigms or "models" for medical advances. We believe that medical history shows that the "bench-to-bedside" model is inadequate to explain most recent progress and that clinical advances themselves often lead to new basic research. Discussion of alternate conceptual frameworks for biomedical research should help lead to changes in funding and organizational structures that might finally revitalize clinical research

In June 1979, the University of Chicago sponsored a national conference on the "plight of clinical investigation in the United States." The proceedings of that conference were published the following year in Perspectives in Biology and Medicine under the title "Clinical Research: Elements for a Prognosis" (Grahn 1980).

As Richard Landau (1980) then wrote, the organizers and participants in that conference "had to be persuaded that there was even a problem—that there might be more than [a general] malaise." Eventually, by anecdotal comparisons with their recollection of a "golden age" in the 25 years following World War II, they were "convinced . . . that there was indeed a definable disease affecting clinical research." However, the data they collected were not clear-cut: they found a marked reduction in the percentage of principal investigators who were MD's, as compared to PhD's, in new National Institutes of Health (NIH) research project grants over the preceding decade, but no drop in what one NIH Institute termed "fundamental clinical research" in its portfolio (Bever and Whedon 1980). Despite these ambiguous portends, Landau suggested that "a repeat study 5 years hence would reveal a near catastrophe." Interestingly, the diagnosis for the [End Page 476] travails of clinical research was felt to be a problem of adaptation, brought on by the successes of the field, and the first of several recommended treatments was to "regain . . . self-confidence" (Landau 1980). It is now clear that either the therapy was not implemented or did not work.

Since the first warnings were articulated in 1979, support for clinical research has become a subject of increasing concern (Wyngaarden 1979; Gill 1984; Ahrens 1992; Kelley and Randolph 1994; Goldstein and Brown 1997; Thompson and Moskowitz 1997; Nathan 1998; Schechter 1998; Shine 1998; Williams, Wara, and Carbone 1998; Rosenberg 1999; Zemlo et al. 2000; Frist 2002; Rosenberg 2003; Sung et al. 2003; Crowley et al. 2004). Now, 25 years later, it is essential to reemphasize the critical need to restore clinical research to a position of prime importance in medical research. Our plea for increased attention to and support of clinical research does not imply rejection of a significant investment in basic biomedical research; rather, it is a call for rebalancing the relation between laboratory investigation and patient-oriented research. Medical advances require a bi-directional flow of information, concepts, and research questions between the clinic and the laboratory. As we discuss below, the "bench-to-bedside" model of medical progress, in which clinical research plays a supporting or derivative role in translating advances in basic science into improvement in clinical practice, is not a viable model for organizing and supporting medical research.

The social justification for all medical research is the improvement of clinical care and the health of individuals and populations. The development of new therapeutics is only one component of medical research. The broad determinants of human health also include socioeconomic factors and behaviors; improvements in health require attention to these factors. Perhaps the most important advance in human health since World War II has been the recognition of the health effects of smoking, which led to the ongoing campaign to reduce cigarette consumption. Recognition of the health effects of smoking came from epidemiological investigation, not from laboratory research; moreover, the improvement in health required behavioral change, rather than drug intervention. The same is probably true for the recently recognized problem of increasing obesity. Unfortunately, downplaying clinical research has significantly impaired attention to many major determinants of health, as well as slowed the development of new therapies of all types.

We organized this special issue of Perspectives in Biology and Medicine with the goal of promoting discussion of the appropriate balance of basic and clinical studies in publicly supported medical research, and of the models that inform our understanding of the pathways that lead to improvements in health care. We invited submission of manuscripts dealing with the development of clinical research in the post-World War II period, with special relevance to the implications of historical processes for understanding the current clinical research enterprise in the United States and abroad. We present here a selection of these submissions [End Page 477] under the broad headings of Historical Perspectives, Case Studies, and Policy Issues. While most of the essays in this issue do not explicitly focus on our concern over the decline in clinical research, all are relevant. We feel that understanding of policy issues confronting clinical research will be greatly assisted by an accessible historical literature. Medical science, including clinical research, does not systematically record its history, yet historical perspective is essential to a sound understanding of clinical research, especially in light of the profound changes in biology and medicine in the last half century.
This Issue of "Perspectives in Biology and Medicine"

The first historical perspective is an essay is by the medical sociologists Judith Swazey and Renée Fox, who recall the "Golden Years" of medical research in the decades following World War II. In those years, clinical research was highly valued by the medical community and the broader society, and it attracted many outstanding young investigators. Regrettably, it appears that clinical research no longer has the prestige or the support it had then. Joel Vilensky, Sid Gilman, and Pandy Sinish describe the career of the neurologist Derek Denny-Brown, whose leadership led to a self-limited and uncommon fluorescence—at one place (Boston City Hospital) and one time (immediately post-World War II)—of clinically applicable research in neurology. Lainie Ross discusses the difficult question of balancing risks and potential benefits for a very important special group—children—in medical research. The effects of many of the institutional constraints on clinical research, including Institutional Review Boards and regulatory agencies, that now pose major barriers to clinical research were just being sensed in 1979. Finally, Gretchen Krueger's essay in this section on the history of the founding of the American Society of Clinical Oncology is informative of how the simultaneous development of a new treatment approach, chemotherapy, and the advent of markedly increased NIH support enabled the formation of a very robust society that still fully combines clinical investigation and patient care. It is interesting, however, that even then (1964-1973), some oncologists worried that the term "clinical" in the organization's name would have negative connotations.

In the first case study, Valerie Williams describes the development of the first effective therapy for sickle cell disease, hydroxyurea. Her account emphasizes the continuous interaction between patient-oriented and laboratory studies that is necessary for therapeutic advances. Theodore Schwartz and Curtis Meinert, in their review of the contentious history of an important clinical trial carried out more than 30 years ago, demonstrate how continued parallel intensive animal research and clinical studies have finally made the controversy moot and have given us a reasonably clear guide to the safe and effective use of sulfonylureas for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Donald Silverberg, Dov Wexler, and Adrian Iaina highlight the difficulty in, and benefits from, getting investigators from different [End Page 478] subspecialties of internal medicine—in this case, cardiology and nephrology—to cooperate in the study and treatment of patients with congestive heart failure and chronic renal insufficiency. Their paper illustrates one of the hazards of the fragmentation of patient care and provides a model for surmounting this problem. Graeme Laver's article on the search for a treatment for influenza shows how diverse and unexpected the pathway to successful drug development can be.

Finally, with regard to policy, Jonathan Rees, a distinguished clinician and investigator in dermatology, offers a frank and often surprising view of what types of medical research have, and are needed to, advance clinical practice. Rees argues that medical advances do not flow from reductionist science and discusses, from a perspective similar to that we use below, the question of "models" of clinical advance.

In two essay reviews, Geoffrey Waites recounts the history of the development of a male contraceptive pill, which promises to play an important role in population control programs, and David Courtwright discusses the importance of social context in medicine, with particular regard to fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Clinical research will play a critical role in helping to evaluate the significance of contested diseases such as FAS.
The Problem of Clinical Research

As editors of this issue of Perspectives in Biology and Medicine we must ask, as did our predecessors 25 years ago, what is the evidence that the situation affecting non-industry sponsored clinical research in the United States is worsening? This decline has been quantified in many ways, especially with regard to the portfolio of the NIH, by far the largest individual funder of medical research. The metrics show marked declines in the portion of NIH funds devoted to clinical research and an immense fall in the proportion of grants awarded to physicians as compared to Ph.D. investigators (Ahrens 1992; Kelley and Randolph 1994; Zemlo et al. 2000). Although clinical work is done by non-physicians, the great majority of funded Ph.D. scientists are laboratory investigators. Further, recent study shows that clinical projects fare less well than basic science in the NIH review process, with few M.D.'s now participating as reviewers (Kotchen et al. 2004). NIH-sponsored M.D.-Ph.D. programs, such as the Medical Scientist Training Program, turn out almost no clinical investigators among their thousands of graduates.

We, and others, believe that the situation is increasingly grave. Indeed, several organizations, such as the Clinical Research Roundtable of the Institute of Medicine and the Association for Patient-Oriented Research, have been recently formed to address this problem. One of the three main goals of the current NIH Director Dr. Elias Zerhouni's NIH Roadmap is "Re-engineering the Clinical Research Enterprise."

To understand the basis and implications of the decline in patient-oriented research [End Page 479] it is necessary to have an accepted definition of "clinical research." This has been debated over the years, with many confusing nuances. For heuristic purposes, we limit the term to the study of human beings or populations of individuals. In the words of Knud Faber (1930), "clinical research must derive its inspiration from the examination of patients" (170). When so inspired, clinical investigation may encompass the whole gamut of research activities, including analyses of disease pathophysiology (for which sophisticated study of normal human biochemistry and physiology is necessary); of the prevention, cause, and course of diseases; and of the effects of interventions (pharmacologic, surgical, behavioral, etc.) on human health. Although the vast array of so-called "translational" research funded by the NIH and similar organizations, especially that involving animals and other organisms, may elucidate valuable biological information, this research should not be confused with clinical research. Indeed, competition of clinical projects with this type of animal research is one of the main reasons why, with all good intentions, the public funding of clinical research is vanishing.

Do not mistake us. We believe that animal experimentation is vital, not only for improving animal health but also for improving human health. Testing of new drugs in animals is essential before these drugs are given to people. But animal models of human disease are just that; they are models (Williams, Haines, and Moore 2004). Thus, murine tumors have turned out to be poor models of human cancers; few of the many interventions that cure cancer in mice have been effective in humans. We may eventually develop animal models of disease that more accurately reflect the natural history of the corresponding human disease. Nonetheless, if our goal is to understand human disease, so that we may prevent, cure, or ameliorate it, we need to recognize Alexander Pope's wisdom, that "the proper study of mankind is man."

The tension between clinical research and laboratory investigation is not new. Faber (1930) describes a similar situation in 19th-century Germany, when medicine "became in a great measure reduced to a kind of accessory science subordinate to pathology and physiology" (81). In his analysis of medicine in this era, Faber concludes, "Whenever its intimate connection with clinical observation has been broken, medical science has been led astray" (162). We fear that the problems Faber decried are recurring today.
Models of the Relation of Medical Research to Clinical Practice

The worsening situation of clinical research is best understood in terms of conceptual paradigms or "models" that, perhaps more implicitly than explicitly, form the basis for how research is chosen for funding. The conventional linear "bench-to-bedside" model holds that basic laboratory research drives clinical research, which in turn drives improvements in clinical practice. As Landau (1980) noted a quarter century ago: "There are those who believe firmly that the important [End Page 480] discoveries in medicine and human biology stem mainly from basic biological discoveries, that clinical research is principally derivative if not 'applied.' The natural corollary of this view is that clinical research may not be so important and that, given time and a modicum of support, the important ideas in clinical research will become evident to almost anyone." Similarly, as Rees states in his article in this issue, "Much of the rationale for much biomedical research is that the reductionist enterprise that I associate with cell biology or biochemistry is the best way to improve health." He characterizes this view as "increasingly insular, partisan, and subject to challenge."

The linear model fails to account for a substantial amount of research-based improvement in health care. In our view, its adverse effects include goal displacement toward basic science, with little accountability, and away from clinical or patient-oriented research; allocation of scarce public resources toward reductionist science and not health needs or the delivery of care; a reinforcement of medical specialization rather than boundary-crossing research; and the minimization of epidemiology as a means to ascertain burden of illness and identify socio-behavioral risk factors that are potentially as amenable to change as biological factors, with great health benefits. The problems of smoking and obesity, noted above, illustrate this.

The recent rise of the discipline of "molecular medicine" is a good example of this trend. Of course it is important to understand the molecular basis and molecular concomitants of disease. Too often, however, this phrase is taken to indicate that the disease is equivalent to certain abnormal molecules and it is the molecules that must be treated (Plotz 1996). Health and disease are attributes of intact, living, integrated organisms, with all their genetic and phenotypic diversity (Williams, Haines, and Moore 2004), not of molecules. Even simple Mendelian diseases, such as sickle-cell anemia, have very variegated clinical manifestations depending on other genetic and environmental factors. While abnormalities in the structure or abundance of molecules may lead to disease, and while interventions designed to overcome these abnormalities may be used to treat disease, it is people who become diseased because of these abnormalities and people who are treated by reversing them or changing other factors.

In recent years, the linear model has been questioned from both conceptual and historical perspectives; alternate models for the general relationships among basic and applied research programs include Stokes's four-quadrant presentation and a variety of "iterative" models (Gelijns and Rosenberg 1994; Stokes 1997; Williams et al. 1976). In the context of biomedical research, these iterative models can be formulated as "bedside to bench to bedside" or "patient to laboratory to patient." Indeed, the classic paper by Comroe and Dripps (1976), which is frequently cited to support the overarching importance of basic studies, shows primarily that the origin of clinical advances comes from many unexpected and probably unpredictable sources, as illustrated by Laver's article in this issue on how field studies on shore birds led to a new influenza drug. [End Page 481]

Historically there are ample examples of patient observations or clinical research leading to crucial new lines of basic research. In the 1979 symposium, Beeson (1980) discussed the diverse origins of clinical advances and the complex iterative processes involved. More recently, Gershon (1998) has shown that such very fundamental areas as the genetic role of DNA and the nature of complex genetic rearrangements developed primarily from initial observations on patients, not from abstract biological studies. In this issue, Williams shows how iterative or more complex models describing the interactions of laboratory studies and primary clinical observations, and not linear models, best explain the recent advances in treating the "first molecular disease," sickle-cell anemia. Thus, "bedside to bench to bedside" should be considered as the simplest appropriate model.
Primacy of Patients and Populations for Publicly Funded Medical Research

Readers of this issue of Perspectives in Biology and Medicine may also query, as did some of the participants in the meeting a quarter century ago, the importance of publicly funded clinical research as compared to the increasing funding of clinical research by industry, with the NIH and foundations supporting basic or translational aspects of biomedical research. This situation leads to major problems with respect to the advancement of health.

First, many crucial areas of study of human disease pathophysiology and pharmacology, upon which new therapies must be based, largely fall between the cracks of the current funding practices and are not being actively pursued. Second, population-based studies for understanding disease patterns and the effects of important variables—such as behavior and diet—are not supported by the commercial sector. As a result, public health measures, which usually do not involve costly medications but which could have enormous effects on the health of large populations, tend to be neglected. Current efforts to find genetic determinants of addiction and to medicalize the obesity "epidemic," rather than to treat these conditions primarily as socioeconomic and behavioral problems, are unfortunate examples of this propensity (Merikangas and Risch 2003). Lastly, domination of clinical research by industry results in the preferential development of costly therapies. Biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies have little incentive to work on possible therapeutic agents unless they have patent rights and the potential market is immense. Ironically, the great current concern on the part of the industry about the decline in newly identified drug molecules appears to many to be a paradoxical direct result of this very structure of the biomedical research enterprise: small-scale clinical trials, formerly the province of academia, have been much reduced, and this results in a barrier to drug development (Flowers and Melmon 1997; Gelijns and Thier 2002).

There is a growing consensus that return to the balance of basic and clinical publicly funded medical research that existed in the 1950s and 1960s would be [End Page 482] preferable to allowing the support of clinical research to decline. Why has it been so difficult to reverse this trend?
What Is Needed to Revitalize Clinical Research?

Because the problems identified 25 years ago have continued to worsen, major changes are urgently needed to finally rectify this drift. This question has been addressed from two very different perspectives. On the one hand, some have suggested that changes are needed in policies at all levels of the medical system: public and private funding sources, regulatory agencies, medical schools, academic health centers, pharmacological companies, and insurance programs. Although this may be true, it leaves the situation in limbo, as no component of the system initiates any major actions, while waiting for others to change. Others have focused on particular components, especially the funding decisions of the NIH and the hiring, promotion, and tenure decisions of medical schools and their affiliated hospitals (Ahrens 1992; Kelley and Randolph 1994; Nathan and Wilson 2003; Rosenberg 1999; Schechter 1998; Thompson and Moskowitz 1997; Williams, Wara, and Carbone 1998). These, most especially the former, are where changes could—in response to the public will—be most easily accomplished and have the greatest effects.

Clearly, major changes are also needed in training programs (including M.S., M.D.-Ph.D., and postgraduate courses in clinical research), in career pathways (with appropriate salary support and opportunity for promotion and tenure), in the availability of role models and mentors, and in the recognition of contributions of investigators on multi-authored publications, as well as, crucially, in the availability of research funding. Common to all of these changes is the need for more financial resources, especially with long-term institutional commitments. However, support will only be forthcoming if our profession values clinical research, as compared to basic research, more highly than it has up to now—which depends implicitly on our conceptual models of medical advancement.
Historical Role of the National Institutes of Health

    [NIH's] mission is science in pursuit of fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to extend healthy life and reduce the burdens of illness and disability. 

—NIH Mission Statement

Although the policies of all of the institutions involved in medical research will ultimately determine the status of clinical research, history suggests that the one institution with the greatest leverage and influence is the NIH. This is related to [End Page 483] its immense budget, but also to its prestige—which dates back to the golden era of its leadership by Dr. James Shannon in the 1950s and 1960s—which influences the policies of many other institutions, both here and abroad. Unfortunately, there has been an unstated, and perhaps even unrealized, shift of the NIH's position in supporting the spectrum of biomedical research during this last half century. Its designation as the National Institutes of Health , in the legislative reorganizations of the late 1940s, initially was interpreted for it to be a medical research agency—with only minor concern to areas of public health, nutrition, behavior, etc., domains that are also central to well-being and health. Some of these responsibilities went to other agencies, such as what is now the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. In other cases, Congress later had to mandate explicitly addition of public health-related programs, such as nutrition and behavioral science, into the NIH portfolio.

In subsequent years, the term medical research to describe the NIH's mandate has frequently been replaced with biomedical research , to describe the rapidly growing component of basic biological research and the concomitant shrinking of clinical research in the NIH's role. More recently some have tried to redefine the NIH's responsibility as basic biomedical research , which, if accepted, would probably further erode its role in translating (in the original biomedical sense) research to the treatment of specific diseases, no less public health goals. Currently, there is also a concerted effort to expand the NIH's role into the physical sciences; the descriptive name that would emerge for this portfolio is unclear.

The opportunities for a "new" clinical research in this new century, as described by Rees (2002, and the article in this issue) and by others (Snyderman 2004), as well as stated in the NIH Roadmap, are enormous. The recent completion of the Human Genome Project and the initiation of other large database-driven "omic" programs, the development of new statistical tools, and the increasing acceptance of the concepts of evidence-based medicine are but a few examples of a new wherewithal to improve human health. Recent discussions by NIH leaders (DeAngelis 2003; Lenfant 2003), the NIH Roadmap for revitalizing the NIH portfolio with a strong emphasis on clinical research, and the NIH's development of some new clinical loan repayment and training programs, are the best signs that the NIH is attempting to regain its historical role as the national and international leader of all facets of medical research.

We are optimistic that if these changes continue, the other components of the medical enterprise—medical schools and hospitals, regulatory and other federal agencies, foundations, etc.—would quickly change their policies so as to promote academic clinical research in the United States. The enemy has been ourselves; this is also the reason why substantial improvement could rapidly occur.
