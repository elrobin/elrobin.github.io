Highlights 
 
• 
 
    A large portion of the gender gap in the life sciences emerges between the post-doctoral and associate professor levels. 
• 
 
    Women transition to principal investigator at about a 20% lower rate than men. 
• 
 
    Gender differences in publication records can explain about 60% of this lower rate. 
• 
 
    The remaining differential stems from women receiving less credit for their citations. 
 
Abstract 
 
We examined the extent to which and why early career transitions have led to women being underrepresented among faculty in the life sciences. We followed the careers of 6,336 scientists from the post-doctoral fellowship stage to becoming a principal investigator (PI) – a critical transition in the academic life sciences. Using a unique dataset that connects individuals’ National Institutes of Health funding histories to their publication records, we found that a large portion of the overall gender gap in the life sciences emerges at this transition. Women become PIs at a 20% lower rate than men. Differences in “productivity” (publication records) can explain about 60% of this differential. The remaining portion appears to stem from gender differences in the returns to similar publication records, with women receiving less credit for their citations.
