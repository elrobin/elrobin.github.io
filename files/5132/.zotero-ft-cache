Introduction

Although monetary rewards have been used for recognizing scientific achievement since the eighteenth century, it is not regarded as the major reward system in science as described by Merton (1973) , in which scientists publish their works and receive the recognition of their peers as the reward. Since academic prizes consisting of cash rewards are awarded only to very few scientific elites, they are considered as a metaphors of prestige rather than simply large sums of money ( Zuckerman, 1992 ). However, the reward system in science changed when the monetary reward incentive for publication was introduced in 1980s. It is reported that this incentive can promote research productivity ( Franzoni et al. , 2011 ) but might create a negative goal displacement effect ( Frey et al. , 2013 ; Osterloh and Frey, 2014 ).

Since the early 1990s, Chinese research institutions have initiated cash-per-publication reward polices in which Chinese scholars can get cash for each eligible publication. The purpose of publishing their works is not only to advance knowledge and win recognition, but also to earn cash ( Sun and Zhang, 2010 ; Wang, 2016 ). Since these cash-per-publication reward policies vary by institution and some policies are internal or confidential, they have never been systematically investigated except for in some case studies. The purpose of this study is to present the landscape of the cash-per-publication reward policy in China [1] and reveal its trend since the late 1990s.
China’s scientific activity

With the significant development of China’s economy, the country’s scientific activity is experiencing a period of rapid growth. As Figure 1 shows, China’s scientific research inputs and outputs have exhibited a consistent growth pattern over the past 20 years; from 1995 to 2013, China’s expenditures on research and development increased almost 33 times from USD5.23 billion [2] to USD177.70 billion, while its number of international publications (indexed by Web of Science (WoS)) increased about 17 times from 13,134 to 232,070 ( National Bureau of Statistics of China, 1996-2014 ). Indeed, China, which has the second-largest share of international scientific production per country since 2009, contributes 16.3 percent of scientific articles indexed by WoS ( Institute of Scientific and Technical Information of China, 2016 ).
Universities in China

In China, although research institutions, enterprises, hospitals not affiliated with universities, and other sectors are all involved in scientific activity, universities play the dominant role in China’s scientific research output, contributing 82.8 percent of monographs and 73.4 percent of journal articles, including 83.0 percent of WoS papers ( National Bureau of Statistics of China, 2015 ). There are 2,595 higher education institutions in China, including 1,236 universities offering undergraduate programs ( Ministry of Education of China, 2016 ). Traditionally these universities vary by ownership, speciality, and region; however, they can also be classified into three tiers by two national research programs: Project 211 and Project 985.

Project 211 was initiated in 1995 by China’s Ministry of Education. The objective of this project was to construct 100 world-class universities in the beginning of the twenty-first century ( Ministry of Education of China, 2000 ). The Chinese Government offers preferential policies and financial support to designated universities who are admitted to this project, and has contributed around USD2.7 billion to it ( Tang and Yang, 2008 ). Eventually, 116 universities were admitted to Project 211, forming an elite group of universities occupying 70 percent of national research funding and supervising 80 percent of doctoral students ( Tang and Yang, 2008 ). Today, 112 universities are still included in Project 211, even after four universities merged.

Project 985 was first announced by Zemin Jiang, former Chairman of the People’s Republic of China, on May 4, 1998, to promote the development of a Chinese equivalent of the US Ivy League ( Chen, 2006 ). This Chinese Ivy League started with nine universities in 2009 and accepted another 30 universities in the following two years. These 39 universities are all Project 211 universities, but receive more government funding than other Project 211 universities ( Mohrman, 2005 ). Both Project 985 and Project 211 ceased admission in 2011, grouping Chinese universities into a three-tier pyramid hierarchy as shown in Figure 2 : 39 universities within Project 985 (hereafter referred to as Tier 1 universities), 73 universities within Project 211 but excluded from Project 985 (hereafter referred to as Tier 2 universities), and 1,124 other universities (hereafter referred to as Tier 3 universities).

To construct world-class universities, the Chinese Government differentiates universities and allocates most funding to a few elite universities, which lead to the “Matthew Effect” ( Merton, 1968 ) among Chinese universities. Figure 3 presents a huge gap between the elite (Tiers 1 and 2) and ordinary (Tier 3) universities in terms of their average annual budgets. From 2002 to 2015, the average annual budget of Tiers 1 and 2 universities increased from USD23.86 to USD113.05 million while the mean budget of Tier 3 universities increased from USD1.89 to USD9.27 million. Tiers 1 and 2 universities’ budget is, on average, 12 times more than Tier 3 universities budget at all times ( Ministry of Education of China, 2003-2016 ). Although a new national research program, “World Class 2.0,” was announced by the Chinese Government in 2016, it was not in effect during the period of our investigation.
The cash-per-publication reward policy in China

Since the 1980s, to increase the international visibility of Chinese research, the number of WoS papers has been used to evaluate the research performance in China of both institutions and individuals ( Gong and Qu, 2010 ). Chinese scholars are required to publish WoS papers to attain promotion, while their affiliated institutions need the number of WoS papers for ranking and funding applications ( Wang and Li, 2015 ). Chinese universities and research institutions also offer preferential policies and monetary rewards to encourage their scholars to publish in journals indexed by WoS ( Peng, 2011 ).

The first cash-per-publication reward policy (hereafter referred to as the cash reward policy) was launched by the Department of Physics at Nanjing University around 1990. Initially, scholars received USD25 for each WoS paper, and the amount increased to between USD60 and USD120 in the mid-1990s ( Swinbanks et al. , 1997 ). As the first to apply the WoS to research evaluation, Nanjing University topped the list of Chinese universities publishing most WoS papers seven years in a row in the 1990s ( Gong and Qu, 2010 ); its research evaluation policy and cash reward policy were then copied by other universities and research institutions. Today, every university and research institution in China has established their own cash reward policies.
Regional differences in China

China consists of 31 provincial-level divisions that were traditionally grouped into seven geographical regions: North, Northeast, Northwest, Center, East, Southwest, and South. Economic development in different regions differs significantly. The gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in the developed regions (i.e. the North, Northeast, East and South) is much higher than those in the developing regions (i.e. the Northwest, Center, and Southwest) as shown in Table I .

Since Chinese universities are financially supported by not only the central government but also the local government, regional differences in economic development may lead to differences in the financial capacities of Chinese universities from different regions. Universities in developed regions may have adequate budgets, offering greater monetary rewards compared to universities in developing regions. As Table I indicates, the average university budgets in the developed regions are much higher than those in the developing regions.
Literature review
Reward system of science

Merton (1973) presents the sociology of science with a reward system and recognition model. He states that science could be regarded as a social institution, with values, norms, and organization ( Merton, 1957, 1973 ). This institution can reward its members (scientists) for their performance. Members can also present their achievements in order to get the rewards ( Merton, 1957 ). Merton (1973) also points out that rewards for scientific achievement can be given only if others recognize it. As a result, scientists are eager to publish their works; peers recognize their achievements by citing or acknowledging them in their own works. Based on Merton’s recognition model ( Merton, 1973 ), the reward system of science can also be described as a reward triangle consisting of authorship, citations, and acknowledgments ( Cronin and Weaver-Wozniak, 1993 ).

Previous studies suggest that other forms of recognition in addition to the “reward triangle” should be added to the reward system of science. Blume and Sinclair (1973) point out that academic prizes, honorary fellowships, and service on academic committees should be recognized as academic achievement. Sugimoto et al. (2008) compare citation counts and academic mentoring impact, and indicate that academic mentorship should also be granted recognition for its contribution to the spread of knowledge. As social media and other forms of dissemination are being incorporated into scientific practices, a multifaceted reward system has been identified that includes social media mentions, readership counts, and so on ( Desrochers et al. , 2015 ).
Academic monetary rewards through time

In 1719, the first academic prize was initiated by Académie des Sciences in France to award scientists who contribute to the advancement of knowledge in astronomy. Thereafter, some academic prizes, with or without cash incentives, were introduced by Académie des Sciences and Royal Society of London to reward new scientific findings or past accomplishments. The establishment of The Nobel Prize, the largest monetary prize in the academic world, turned the academic prize into a metaphor for accomplishment and prestige ( Zuckerman, 1977 ). There are now various academic prizes with big monetary rewards recognizing academic achievement locally and internationally. These large awards reshape the reward system of science’s upper reaches ( Zuckerman, 1992 ).

However, since these rich academic prizes are awarded only to very few outstanding scholars, they are valued on the basis of their representations of honors rather than their cash values ( Zuckerman, 1992 ). In addition, Merton (1957) even claims that winning the monetary reward should not be the main purpose of any scientific activity because it may break the norm of disinterestedness, referring to rewards for action unaffected by self-interest. He states that:

    Like other institutions also, science has its system of allocating rewards for performance of roles. These rewards are largely honorific, since even today, when science is largely professionalized; the pursuit of science is culturally defined as being primarily a disinterested search for truth and only secondarily a means of earning a livelihood

    ( Merton, 1957 ).

In 1986, the UK adopted the Research Assessment Exercise, which allocates national funds to departments based on past performance and peer review. The monetary incentives to publish, regarded as a reform, spread over the world afterwards; some countries even introduced a system of cash bonuses to individuals rather than institutions for each article published in top international scientific journals ( Franzoni et al. , 2011 ). Indeed, the economic incentives affect the university research at both the institution ( Thursby et al. , 2001 ; Thursby and Thursby, 2002 ) and the individual levels ( Frey et al. , 2013 ; Osterloh and Frey, 2014 ).
The monetary reward in China

As described above, the cash reward policy was launched in China to promote scientific productivity and publication. Through case studies, some Chinese scholars found that monetary rewards could increase scholars’ motivation and improve productivity in publishing WoS papers ( Li and Zhang, 2008 ; Zeng et al. , 2012 ; Li and Zhong, 2013 ; Shan et al. , 2013 ). However, no study compares the cash reward policies in different universities nor presents the landscape of the monetary reward for publications in China.

Cash reward policies also create some negative effects. Chinese researchers may favor fast research that leads to quick, cashable publications as opposed to long-term research; in essence, publishing in WoS journals can become the only research goal ( Jin and Rousseau, 2004 ). Some Chinese scientists may resort to plagiarized or fabricated research, purchase ghostwritten papers, or sell authorship ( Qiu, 2010 ; Hvistendahl, 2013 ). Monetary reward also amplifies the existing “Matthew Effect” among Chinese universities ( Zhong and Chen, 2008 ). Compared with Tier 3 universities, Tiers 1 and 2 universities dominate scientific resources, and thus could offer more cash rewards for publications, motivating their scholars to produce more ( Qi, 2009 ; Li, 2013 ).

Since the monetary reward is an internal award, it is only announced by Chinese universities via internal documents. Some universities even keep it confidential to avoid competition from other universities. Although the cash reward policy has been applied for 20 years, we still know little about the range of amounts paid to individuals for publications; if the cash reward varies with the quality of journals; if the cash reward policy differs significantly from one university to another. The purpose of this study is to present the landscape of the cash-per-publication reward policy in China and address these questions.

Please note that the scope of this study is limited to research in natural science, including engineering and medical science. Since social science and humanities have more localized interests in research and varied methods of disseminating knowledge, beyond journal publications, most Chinese universities have different systems for evaluating and rewarding research performance in social science and the humanities. For Chinese scholars in social science and humanities, there are additional approaches to winning cash rewards, such as publishing articles in domestic journals or publishing monographs. On the other hand, the cash rewards are only applied to publications in WoS journals in natural science.
Methodology
Data collection

In order to present the landscape of the cash-per-publication reward policy in China, we sampled 100 Chinese universities and investigated their cash reward policies since the 1990s. Both stratified sampling and convenience sampling were used.

First, considering the three-tier pyramid hierarchy of Chinese universities and regional differences, we classified all 1,236 Chinese universities into 21 categories by tiers and regions. Second, we tried to retrieve the cash reward policies from universities in each category to ensure that the sample is representative. Since most cash reward policies are recorded in internal documents that may not be externally accessible, we had to select universities from each category based on data availability. We used the Chinese search engine Baidu to locate such information and retrieved it from the official websites of each selected university [3] . Finally, a manual validation was conducted to ensure that the retrieved documents were official and valid.

As Table II shows, 100 Chinese universities were selected for the investigation: 25 universities in Tier 1, 33 universities in Tier 2, and 42 universities in Tier 3. The samples also represent Chinese universities from all seven regions in China, as discussed above. Since some Chinese universities had multiple cash reward policies (e.g. modified or new ones), two or more cash reward policies were found in some universities during the period of the investigation. Eventually, 168 cash reward policies were retrieved from these 100 universities. In all, 45 universities contributed one policy each, while 45 universities contributed two; Zhejiang University and Guizhou Normal University issued five and four cash reward policies, respectively, while eight universities contributed three each. The first cash reward policy that we found was issued in 1999; the number of cash reward policies increased afterwards and reached its peak of 21 in 2015. Eight policies were even issued in 2016 as we started this investigation.

Due to limited data availability, we did not use random sampling for our data collection, which is a limitation for this study. When comparing the science and technology personnel (S&T personnel), number of international publications, research funding received, and the number of graduate students between the sample and the population (see Table III ), we found that the means of these indicators from the sample of Tier 1 universities were very close to those means from all Tier 1 universities, while the means from the sample of Tier 2 universities were only a little higher than the means from all Tier 2 universities. The Tier 3 sample seemed to include many top Tier 3 universities so that the sample means were much higher than the average of all Tier 3 universities. We also did the one-sample t-test ( α =0.05) comparing the sample means with the population means to test whether the samples are representative. As Table III shows, we did not find any significant difference between sample and population in all four indicators in Tiers 1 and 2 and one indicator (S&T personnel) in Tier 3; significant difference was found between the Tier 3 sample and population in terms of the number of international publications, the research funding received, and the number of graduate. The t -test indicated that the Tiers 1 and 2 samples represented the population well while the Tier 3 sample representativeness was weaker in this study.
Data analysis

Each cash reward policy contains various specifications about its criteria for the eligibility, amount, formula for calculation, and method of payment. It was difficult to compare different cash reward policies with different specifications. In order to compare the cash reward policies issued by different universities in different years, we selected some journals as examples and calculated the amounts of cash reward for a single research paper published in these journals according to different cash reward policies. The selected journals represent journals with different journal impact factors (JIFs) and in different Journal Citation Report (JCR) Quartiles. For a good understanding of the comparison, we selected a list of nine popular journals that could be recognized by our readers, including four multidisciplinary science journals (the first four) and five library and information science journals (the last five) as shown in Table IV .

Both the JIF of selected journals and the JCR Quartile in which these journals are located were used to calculate the amount of cash rewarded by most cash reward policies. Please note that we chose the five-year JIF instead of the two-year JIF because the former was more frequently used by Chinese universities. Also, the JCR Quartile applied to the cash reward policies is not the original one with four equal quarters, but a modified one made by the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Compared to the original JCR Quartile grouping journals in each discipline into four equal quarters, the modified JCR Quartile use a pyramid hierarchy instead: only the top 5 percent of journals in each discipline are grouped into the Q 1 while journals ranked in 5-20 percent, 20-50 percent and the bottom 50 percent are grouped into Q 2, Q 3 and Q 4 in the modified JCR Quartile, respectively.
Results

A landscape of the cash-per-publication reward policy in China emerged as all 168 cash reward policies were analyzed. Chinese universities offer cash rewards that range from USD30 to USD165,000 for a single paper published in journals indexed by WoS, and the average reward amount has been increasing for the past ten years. The results show us the overview of the cash-per-publication reward policies in terms of eligibility, amount, diversity, and trends.
Eligibility and method

WoS, which includes the Science Citation Index Expanded, the Social Science Citation Index, the Arts and Humanities Citation Index and the Conference Proceedings Citation Index, plays a crucial role in China’s cash reward policies. WoS data and the JCR are used as the eligibility criteria and the grade of the cash reward. Among all cash reward policies, only WoS papers are eligible for the cash reward, except that some universities offer small cash awards to papers indexed by Engineering Index (EI) [4] ; WoS papers published in different journals may be awarded different amounts according to the journal’s JIF and JCR Quartiles. Based on the analysis of the sampled 168 cash reward policies, we grouped policies into the following four major categories:

    One-price reward (31): universities pay the same amount to all WoS papers regardless of where these papers are published.

    Original JIF-based reward (49): universities award eligible papers different amounts based on the JIF of the journals in which the papers are published. Some universities assigned different grades to eligible journals on the basis of their JIF and pay more for papers published in journals with a high grade; some universities use the JIF as the multiplier to differentiate the cash reward (e.g. the amount of cash reward is equal to a basic amount times the JIF).

    JCR Quartiles-based reward (99) [5] : universities award eligible papers different amounts based on the modified JCR Quartile of the journals provided by Chinese Academy of Science that these papers published.

    Citation-based reward (15): universities award papers on the basis of the number of citations they received in a given citation window [6] . Some universities set up a threshold of the number of citations, and award papers that are above that threshold; some universities use the Essential Science Indicators (e.g. hot paper and highly cited paper) as the threshold and award these papers.

Among these 168 cash reward policies, we found 31, 49, 99, and 15 policies that fell into these four categories, respectively. These numbers sum to over 168 because some cash reward policies were grouped into more than one category when universities apply multiple methods to reward their international publications. We also found trends in the cash reward policies in effect in the following three stages from the late 1990s onwards, as shown in Figure 4 . Both the one-price reward policies and the original JIF-based reward policies were popular in the late 1990s and early 2000s, but their shares decreased when the JCR Quartile-based policy was introduced. Since 2005, more and more Chinese universities have adopted the JCR Quartile-based policy, which became the dominant policy from 2013 onwards.
Authorship

The amount of cash awarded per WoS paper varies from USD30 to USD165,000. Not all authors of a paper can claim cash rewards. In 118 out of 168 cash reward policies, universities only award cash to the first author; some universities even require that the awarded author must be both the first author and the corresponding author (22 out of these 118 policies). Among 25 exceptional policies, universities award cash to non-first authors whose papers were published in particular prestigious journals (e.g. Nature , Science ). Only 13 policies indicate that non-first authors may be awarded for all eligible publications, as they could get a discounted amount (e.g. half for the second author, a quarter for the third, etc.). In addition, there is no specific requirement for authorship in 12 out of 168 policies.
Amount of the cash reward

After analyzing 75 policies from 40 Chinese universities [7] that had the cash reward policy in effect between 2008 and 2016, we inferred a cash reward policy by calculating the average cash award for papers published in nine selected journals as described above. We also found that Chinese universities increased the amount of cash reward on average between 2008 and 2016 as shown in Table V :

    Nature and Science : among most cash reward policies, publishing a paper in these two prestigious journals [8] would receive special treatment. Chinese universities offer the highest cash reward to Nature or Science papers. The author(s) may receive a prize up to USD165,000; some universities even announced that the amount of cash rewarded for a Nature or Science paper was negotiable. Indeed, the average amount of cash awarded for a Nature or Science paper increased 67 percent from USD26,212 in 2008 to USD43,783 in 2016.

    PNAS: although Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences is also a prestigious journal, it is not recognized by Chinese universities for special treatment. However, based on its JIF and JCR Quartile ranking, the average cash award for a PNAS paper is more than USD3,000, increasing slightly from USD3,156 in 2008 to USD3,513 in 2016.

    PLOS ONE: although PLOS ONE is ranked as a Q 1 journal in the original JCR Quartile, it is categorized as a Q 3 journal by the modified version of JCR provided by the Chinese Academy of Science. As a result, the amount awarded to a PLOS ONE paper is only around USD1,000, and this even declined from USD1,096 in 2008 to USD984 in 2016.

    MIS Quarterly and JASIST : both journals are ranked as Q 1 journals in their category (Library and Information Science) by JCR. MIS Quarterly ’s JIF is higher than JASIST ’s, although the latter is recognized as the top journal in Library and Information Science, and so the average amount of cash awarded for a MIS Quarterly article is higher than that for a JASIST paper. From 2008 to 2016, the average amount of cash awarded for a MIS Quarterly paper slightly increased from USD2,613 in 2008 to USD2,938 in 2016, while the average amount of cash awarded to a JASIST paper increased 43 percent from USD1,737 in 2008 to USD2,488 in 2016.

    Journal of Documentation : as a journal ranked Q 2 by the JCR, the average amount cash awarded to a paper published in Journal of Documentation is over USD1,000. The average amount increased from USD1,082 in 2008 to USD1,482 in 2016.

    Library Hi Tech and LIBRI : Although both journals are indexed by WoS, they are, respectively, ranked as Q 3 and Q 4 journals in JCR because of their low JIF. These rankings are reflected in the cash rewards: the average amount of cash awarded to papers published in these two journals is below USD800. The average amount to LIBRI paper even decreased from USD650 in 2008 to USD484 in 2016.

In summary, Chinese universities differentiate the amount of cash reward based on the JIF and JCR Quartile of journals in which the awarded papers are published. The average amount of cash awarded by paper has increased over the past ten years, except that the amount awarded to papers published in journals with low JIF has decreased. Publications in Nature and Science are awarded the largest amount of cash reward. This trend is also reflected by the change of five cash reward policies from Zhejiang University as shown in Table VI . The amount of cash awarded for publications in prestigious journals (i.e. Nature, Science , and PNAS ) increased while the amount for publications in other journals declined. Only the first author could receive cash rewards, except that non-first authors could get a discounted amount when publishing in Nature or Science.
Difference by tier and region

We also found that universities in different tiers have different preferences when choosing their cash reward policies. In all, 14 out of 15 citation-based reward policies were issued by Tiers 1 and 2 universities, while 60 percent of the one-price reward policies were issued by Tier 3 universities. Such preferences also differ in universities from different regions. About 90 percent of universities in developed regions preferred either the original JIF-based reward policies or the JCR Quartile-based reward policies, while 60 percent of the one-price reward policies were favored by universities in developing regions.

It was unexpected that Tier 3 universities offered to pay more by publication than Tiers 1 and 2 universities, despite having smaller budgets. As Table VII shows, in 2016, Tier 3 universities paid double or even triple what Tiers 1 and 2 universities did for a paper published in some journals. The average amount of cash reward at Tier 2 universities for papers published in these journals are between the amounts paid by Tiers 3 and 1 universities, respectively. However, we did not find any significant difference in the average amount of cash reward among universities from different regions.
Discussion

Traditionally, the monetary reward incentive is used in business to reward employees for excellent job performance ( Aguinis et al. , 2013 ). Chinese universities apply this to reward their scholars for research performance, thus promoting publication productivity. Considering the low annual salaries of Chinese scholars – the average annual salary of university professors is around USD8,600, while the average basic salary of newly hired professors is only about USD3,100 ( Altbach, 2012 ) [9] – the amount of cash-per-publication reward is a huge incentive: the reward value for a JASIST paper is equal to a single year’s salary for a newly hired professor while the cash award for a Nature or Science article is up to 20 times a university professors’ average annual salary. The cash reward policy has been successful as China’s international scientific publication has experienced a period of exponential increase in the past 20 years.

On the other hand, the monetary reward incentive also brings some negative effects. Chinese scholars may regard the monetary reward as an extrinsic rather than an intrinsic motivator ( Kohn, 1993 ; Aguinis et al. , 2013 ). In other words, they are driven to publish just for the monetary reward rather than disseminating knowledge and receiving the recognition defined by the reward system of science ( Merton, 1973 ). For example, Professor Gao from Heilongjiang University published 279 papers in a single journal, Acta Crystallographica Section E, and received more than half of the total cash rewards given by Heilongjiang University between 2004 and 2009 ( Lei and Lai, 2010 ). In this case, the monetary reward incentive creates a negative goal displacement effect ( Frey et al. , 2013 ; Osterloh and Frey, 2014 ). Professor Gao’s only research focus in these five years was to find new crystal structures in his lab and to report the results of this to the same journal, because he could accomplish the goal of winning the cash bonus in a short term as contrasted with receiving fewer awards by conducting long-term research projects ( Lei and Lai, 2010 ). In addition, academic fraud in China, such as plagiarism, academic dishonesty, ghostwritten papers, fake peer review scandal, and so on also appeared in a growing number of publications ( Hvistendahl, 2013 ). After searching the WoS, we found that the number of paper corrections authored by Chinese scholars increased from two in 1996 to 1,234 in 2016, a historic high.

This study also indicates the abusive use of bibliometric indicators in these cash reward policies. Although the JIF is widely recognized to be a poor metric for evaluating the quality of individual papers ( Seglen, 1997 ; Archambault and Larivière, 2009 ; Lozano et al. , 2012 ), it is used in almost all cash reward policies as the golden rule [10] to assess the value of individual research. In addition, this study reveals that WoS is the only data source accepted in these cash reward policies except for some universities, which offer small cash awards to papers indexed by EI. Although Scopus could be an alternative to WoS in bibliometric studies ( Norris and Oppenheim, 2007 ; Torres-Salinas et al. , 2009 ) and indexes more Chinese journals ( Mongeon and Paul-Hus, 2016 ), it is not recognized by Chinese universities. It also means that publications not indexed by WoS, including millions of papers published in Chinese journals, are almost all ignored and excluded from the cash reward.

We also found a positive trend among these cash reward policies. The focus of the cash reward policy changed from the quantity to the quality of the international publications when Chinese universities (especially Tier 1 and 2 universities) had published an adequate number of WoS papers. This was why many one-price reward policies have been replaced by JCR Quartile-based or citation-based policies since 2008. In order to promote impact instead of quantity, these universities increased the amount of cash reward for papers published in Q 1 and Q 2 journals and decreased or stopped payment for papers published in Q 3 and Q 4 journals. A few universities even abandoned using the JIF and instead used the citation counts as the criterion for evaluating the quality of individual papers in citation-based reward policies. The hierarchical difference among universities was indicated in this trend change. When Tiers 1 and universities reduced or canceled the cash reward for papers published in journals with low JIF (e.g. Q 3 and Q 4 journals), some Tier 3 universities increased the amount for the same category papers. Indeed, Tier 3 universities have higher demand than Tiers 1 and 2 universities for both the quantity and the quality of international publications, so Tier 3 universities pay more cash for each individual paper.
Conclusion

In this study, after investigating 168 cash-per-publication reward policies from 100 Chinese universities, we described the landscape of the cash-per-publication reward policy in China and revealed its trends since the late 1990s. Chinese universities apply the monetary reward incentive used in business to promote scientific publication productivity, which lead to a radical increase in China’s international scholarly publication. The cash-per-publication reward policy also produces the “Matthew Effect” ( Merton, 1968 ) among university professors, as the amount of cash awarded for publications is much higher than professors’ annual salaries. Publications bring scholars not only cash rewards but also the possibility of future funding and promotion, which reveals the golden rule of academia in China: publish or impoverish.

This study revealed that monetary reward policies have been widely used to promote research productivity; these monetary reward policies might bring some negative effects while improving the research productivity, which was not systematically investigated by previous studies. We still know little about the potential impact of these monetary reward policies on research activities, which should be explored in the future. The landscape presented in this study could form a foundation for future studies that investigates the determinants and consequences of monetary reward policies.

Some limitations exist in this study. Due to limited data availability, we used convenience sampling, which may influence the sample representation as compared with sampling randomly, and the sampling fraction in Tier 3 universities is much lower than that of Tiers 1 and 2 universities. Social sciences and humanities are also not included in this study. We hope that future research could collect more data and overcome such limitations. Although this study presents a landscape of the cash-per-publication reward policy in China, we did not investigate if a correlation between the cash reward policy and the number of publications exists, which could be explored by future research.

Notes
1.

In this study, China refers to the Mainland China, which is the geopolitical area under the direct jurisdiction of the People’s Republic of China excluding Hong Kong and Macau.
2.

In this study, all cash values in Chinese yuan (CNY) were converted to US dollar (USD) at the rate CNY1=USD0.15. The exchange rate was retrieved from xe.com on October 3, 2016.
3.

Some internal documents or information regarding the cash reward policies were provided privately by university staff.
4.

Engineering Index is an engineering bibliographic database published by Elsevier. It indexes scientific literature pertaining to engineering materials.
5.

Although the JCR Quartile is also based on the JIF, JCR Quartile provides a structural hierarchy that groups all journals into four categories, which the original JIF-based method does not.
6.

The citation window varies in different universities; some universities use a five-year citation window while other universities use a three-year citation window; some universities even count the citations at any time.
7.

In order to keep the analysis consistent, 60 universities were excluded because their first cash reward policies were issued in 2009 and after.
8.

Some Chinese universities add Cell to this list of prestige journals; but most universities only recognize Nature and Science .
9.

In his book, Altbach used the purchasing power parity index instead of the pure salary based on the exchange rate for the comparison of professors’ salary among 28 countries. It means that the annual salaries of Chinese scholars here (USD8,600 and USD3,100) represent the amount having the same purchase power as USD8,600 and USD3,100 in the USA, respectively.
10.

Although the JCR Quartile is frequently used in the cash reward policies, the ranking of JCR Quartile is also on the basis of JIF.
