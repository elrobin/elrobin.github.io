Abstract

Percentiles have been established in bibliometrics as an important alternative to mean-based indicators for obtaining a normalized citation impact of publications. Percentiles have a number of advantages over standard bibliometric indicators used frequently: for example, their calculation is not based on the arithmetic mean which should not be used for skewed bibliometric data. This study describes the opportunities and limits and the advantages and disadvantages of using percentiles in bibliometrics. We also address problems in the calculation of percentiles and percentile rank classes for which there is not (yet) a satisfactory solution. It will be hard to compare the results of different percentile-based studies with each other unless it is clear that the studies were done with the same choices for percentile calculation and rank assignment.
Highlights

► Percentiles have been established as an important alternative to mean-based indicators for obtaining a normalized citation impact. ► Percentiles and percentile rank classes have a number of advantages over the mean-based indicators. ► There are still (minor) issues that have to be solved both on the side of the calculation of percentiles as on the assignment of percentiles to classes. ► It will be hard to compare the results of different studies with each other unless it is clear that the studies were done with the same choices for percentile calculation and rank assignment.

1. Using reference sets

Since the 1980s, reference sets have been used for the normalization of citations in bibliometrics (see the overview in Vinkler, 2010 ). The purpose of reference sets is to allow the citation impact of a publication to be evaluated in comparison with the citation impact of similar publications. The use of reference sets is necessary as numerous studies have shown that citations depend not only on the quality of a publication, but also on many other factors. The factors which are commonly considered in bibliometrics to have a significant impact on citations are the subject category/area, the publication year, and the document type of a publication. Many studies ( Bornmann & Daniel, 2008 ) have revealed that other factors, such as the number of authors or the length of a publication, influence citations systematically; however, these other factors are not taken account of in the creation of reference sets. Presumably because it is not possible to assume a significant influence in all fields, and not all studies could consistently show a significant influence.

Since reference sets have been used, arithmetic means have been calculated to normalize citations of a publication or to make them comparable with others (see an overview on the different methods in Vinkler, 2012 ). The reference set was made up of publications which were published in the same subject area, the same publication year, and with the same document type as the publications in question. The arithmetic mean value of the citations for the publications in the reference set was calculated to specify an expected citation impact ( Schubert & Braun, 1986 ). With the citation impact of the publications in question and the expected citation impact a quotient was built: the mean observed citation rate (MOCR) divided by the mean expected citation rate (MECR). Using this quotient (the Relative Citation Rate, RCR) instead of raw citation counts – for example, the citation impact of a publication in the subject area of chemistry published five years ago – was held to be comparable with the impact of a physics publication published ten years ago. Furthermore, it was now possible to analyze the overall citation impact for a publication set even if the publications were published in different fields and publication years, or as different document types.

More recently, the use of RCR (or its derivatives such as CPP/FCSm, see Moed, Debruin, & Van Leeuwen, 1995 ) and NMCR ( Glänzel, Thijs, Schubert, & Debackere, 2009 ) was criticized because a quotient does not allow for testing differences on their statistical significance ( Opthof & Leydesdorff, 2010 ), respectively. The alternative measure (the mean normalized citation score, MNCS, Waltman, van Eck, van Leeuwen, Visser, & van Raan, 2011 ) is based on first normalizing each individual paper's citations against its reference standard and then taking the mean. However, there is a significant disadvantage inherent in the calculation of means for the normalization of citations ( Bornmann, Mutz, Marx, Schier, & Daniel, 2011 ): as a rule, a distribution of citation counts over publications sets is skewed. The arithmetic mean value calculated for a reference set may therefore be determined by a few highly cited publications. The arithmetic mean as a measure of central tendency is not suitable for skewed data ( Bornmann et al., 2011 ).

For example, in the Leiden Ranking 2011/2012 the University of Göttingen is only in position 2 in a ranking based on mean-based quotients (MNCS) because the indicator for this university “turns out to have been strongly influenced by a single extremely highly cited publication” ( Waltman et al., 2012 , p. 10). Attributions which would thus describe the citation impact as excellent or outstanding are based on erroneous assumptions about the citation distributions. Given the skewness of the distributions, nonparametric statistics should be used ( Leydesdorff, Bornmann, Mutz, & Opthof, 2011 ).
2. The calculation of percentiles

A percentile is a value below which a certain proportion of the observations fall. Percentiles (and therefore also percentile rank classes, PRs) offer an alternative to mean-based quotients. Generally speaking, (1) percentiles are not as strongly influenced by extreme values of the distribution as the mean value ( Waltman et al., 2012 , p. 10); (2) they do not depend on the choice of a specific probability density function in comparison to the arithmetic mean, which requires normally distributed data; (3) percentiles can be calculated, even if the data are skewed, as it is usual for bibliometric data; and (4) once calculated, they also permit the classification of publications into meaningful citation impact classes ( Bornmann, in press-b , Leydesdorff, in press , Rousseau, 2012  and  Schreiber, 2012 ). With a reference set it is possible to determine, for example, whether a publication belongs to the 1% or 10% of the most cited publications in the reference set or not.

Three steps are needed in order to calculate the percentiles for a reference set (see sample data in Table 1 ):
