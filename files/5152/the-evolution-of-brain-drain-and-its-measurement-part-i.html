			<div class="single-post"><h3>The origin of the ‘brain drain’</h3>
<p>In the years immediately following the end of hostilities in the 
Second World War, large numbers of highly skilled scientists emigrated 
from Western Europe to the United States. In the UK, concerns over the 
‘loss’ of British researchers began to be raised in the early 1950s, as 
the weight of anecdotal (and limited direct) evidence began to mount. By
 the early 1960s the issue had become politicized and the Royal Society 
was tasked with reporting on the nature and extent of the problem. Their
 report, ‘Emigration of scientists from the United Kingdom’, was 
published in 1963 and received much media attention, but it was the <em>Evening Standard </em>newspaper that subsequently coined the term that was to encapsulate the concept: ‘brain drain’<sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Over time, the concept of brain drain has shifted in meaning 
and complexity, and is now generally understood to describe the shift of
 researchers from any country (typically less scientifically developed) 
to any other (typically more scientifically developed). Brain drain, as 
fits the negative connotations of the term, was usually considered as a 
win-lose scenario.</p>
<h3>New models, new approaches</h3>
<p>In recent years, the theoretical framework surrounding scientific 
mobility and migration has become sufficiently developed to require the 
coinage of a new term: brain circulation<sup>2</sup>. According to this 
concept, nations are not considered as winners or losers but as loci in a
 dynamic system of human capital flows. Within this system, countries 
may accrue benefits to their domestic scientific capacity through 
diaspora effects (where the knowledge, skills and professional networks 
established by emigrant researchers while abroad are shared with 
colleagues at home) and return rates (where emigrant researchers return 
to their home countries after a period of working abroad, bringing with 
them the experiences they have gained)<sup>3</sup>. Such benefits are intangible and as such are difficult to quantify.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Methodologically, studies of brain circulation have traditionally drawn on census or migration data<sup>2</sup>, surveys of researchers<sup>4,5</sup>, CV analysis<sup>6,7</sup>, or a combination of methods<sup>8</sup>. However, empirical data<strong> </strong>showed
 that brain circulation cannot be modeled as a purely random process, 
since there are barriers of language, politics, culture and so on that 
may act to encourage or prevent a given researcher from moving to a 
given country. Another more recent study offered the interesting 
approach of using job advertisements posted on the website of a 
well-known science weekly to measure brain circulation, but showed that 
selection bias in the advert placements ruled out the broad 
applicability of this method<sup>9</sup>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;With the advent of comprehensive and sophisticated online 
publication databases that are populated with peer-reviewed articles 
with complete author affiliation (address) data, new possibilities have 
opened up for wide-ranging studies of brain circulation. The development
 of a methodological framework using these databases was pioneered by 
Dr. Grit Laudel, currently at the University of Twente in the 
Netherlands. In her 2003 article ‘Studying the brain drain: can 
bibliometric methods help?’<sup>10</sup>, she presented the first 
systematic attempt to use authors’ listed addresses in published 
articles as a proxy for their location, so allowing tracking of their 
migration patterns over time. This study presented preliminary results 
demonstrating a net movement of ‘elite’ researchers to the US from the 
rest of the world (in a single specialty, angiotensin research).</p>
<p>&nbsp;Using the same approach, Laudel subsequently expanded her study
 to demonstrate that while elite migration to the US can be found at the
 level of individual specialties (such as angiotensin research), the 
proportion of elite researchers in the US remained almost constant in 
the period 1980–2002<sup>11</sup>. This finding across all subject 
fields appears to mask great lower-level variability, as Laudel 
demonstrates by contrasting the net gain over time of elite researchers 
by the US in angiotensin research with the relatively steady-state, 
US-centric elite researcher population of the vibrational spectroscopy 
community. Migration rates are therefore also likely to vary 
considerably at lower levels of aggregation than an entire country, such
 as at region, state, city or institution level.</p>
<h3>Designing a novel approach to brain circulation mapping</h3>
<p>As part of the report ‘<a href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/science/science-innovation-analysis/uk-research-base">International Comparative Performance of the UK Research Base: 2011</a>’,
 commissioned by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills 
(BIS), a fresh way of looking at researcher mobility was sought. In the 
report, published in October 2011, the Scopus database was used to 
produce a conceptual map of the stocks and flows of human capital in the
 UK over the 15-year period 1996–2010 (results detailed in Part II of 
this article in the next issue).</p>
<p>&nbsp;In an important departure from previous studies using author 
affiliation data as a proxy for measuring brain circulation, this work 
was not confined to authors belonging to an elite or to a single subject
 or specialty (c.f. Refs 12–13). Instead, the approach presented in the 
report uses Scopus author profile data to derive a history of an 
author’s affiliations recorded in their publications and to assign them 
to mobility classes defined by the type and duration of observed moves. 
There were several conceptual and methodological issues to be resolved 
before the map could be built:</p>
<h4>1. How can we unambiguously assign articles to their authors?</h4>
<p>A longstanding problem in researcher mobility studies has been the 
unambiguous identification of the individual14, as there are common 
family names in every language and country, and multiple variants of a 
given person’s name in the published literature. In order to overcome 
these problems, Scopus has improved its author-profiling algorithm in 
order to identify individual researchers precisely. The <a href="http://www.info.sciverse.com/scopus/scopus-in-detail/tools/authoridentifier/">Scopus Author Identifier</a>
 gives each author a separate ID and groups together all the documents 
written by that author, matching alternate spellings and variations of 
the author’s last name and distinguishing between authors using 
sophisticated algorithm based on data elements associated with the 
article (such as affiliation, subject area, co-authors and so on).</p>
<h4>2. What is a ‘UK researcher’?</h4>
<p>Author nationality is not captured in article or author profiling 
data, and there are serious methodological difficulties in using 
cultural indicators (such as family names) as a proxy for nationality of
 birth<sup>15</sup>. So for this study, authors were assumed to be from 
the first country from which they have published, or from the country 
where they published the majority of their articles, when looking at 
migratory or transitory mobility respectively (see point 4 below). These
 criteria may, in individual cases, result in authors being assigned to 
migratory patterns that may not accurately reflect the real situation, 
but such errors may be assumed to be evenly distributed across the 
groups and so the overall pattern remains valid. To define the initial 
population for study, UK authors were identified as those that had 
listed a UK affiliation on at least one publication (articles, reviews 
and conference papers) published across the 18,000 journals included in 
Scopus during the period 1996–2010. This list included about 1.5 million
 unique authors.</p>
<h4>3. What is an ‘active researcher’?</h4>
<p>The 1.5 million UK researchers identified includes a large proportion
 of authors with relatively few publications (with UK or non-UK 
affiliations) over the entire 15-year period of analysis. As such, it 
was assumed that they are not likely to represent career researchers, 
but individuals who have left the research system. As such, a 
productivity filter was put in place to restrict to those authors with 
at least 1 article in the latest 5-year period (2006–2010) and at least 
10 articles in the entire 15-year period (1996–2010), or those with 
fewer than 10 articles in 1996–2010 but more than at least 4 articles in
 2006–2010. After applying the productivity filter, a set of 210,923 
active UK researchers was defined and formed the basis of the study.</p>
<h4>4. How should long- and short-term mobility be defined?</h4>
<p>The study of brain circulation is complicated by the difficulties in 
teasing apart the related phenomena of long-term migration from 
short-term mobility (such as doctoral research visits, sabbaticals, 
secondments and so on), which might be deemed a form of collaboration. 
Defining a time period for a stay abroad over and above which it should 
be considered a permanent migration (migratory mobility), and below 
which should be deemed a short-term research visit (transitory 
mobility), is difficult. Drawing on the definition by Crawford <em>et al</em>.<sup>16</sup>,
 stays abroad of 2 years or more were considered migratory and were 
further subdivided into those where the researcher remained abroad or 
where they subsequently returned to their original country. Stays abroad
 of less than 2 years were deemed transitory, and were also further 
subdivided into those who mostly published under a UK or a non-UK 
affiliation. Researchers without any apparent mobility based on their 
published affiliations were treated as a separate group.</p>
<h4>5. What indicators were applied to understand the groups better?</h4>
<p>To better understand the composition of each group defined on the 
map, two aggregate indicators were calculated for each to represent, in a
 relative sense, the publication productivity and seniority of the 
researchers they contain. Relative Productivity represents a measure of 
the articles per year since the first appearance of each researcher as 
an author during the period 1996–2010, relative to all UK researchers in
 the same period, while Relative Seniority represents years since the 
first appearance of each researcher as an author during the period 
1996–2010, relative to all UK researchers in the same period. Both 
Relative Productivity and Relative Seniority are calculated for each 
author’s entire output in the period (i.e., not just those articles 
listing a UK address).</p>
<address>Part II of this article (to be published in the next issue of 
Research Trends) will present the brain circulation map of the UK in 
which these methodological issues have been addressed, and its 
interpretation.</address>
