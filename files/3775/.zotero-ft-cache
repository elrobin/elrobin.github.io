Although there is some evidence that online videos are increasingly used by academics for informal scholarly communication and teaching, the extent to which they are used in published academic research is unknown. This article explores the extent to which YouTube videos are cited in academic publications and whether there are significant broad disciplinary differences in this practice. To investigate, we extracted the URL citations to YouTube videos from academic publications indexed by Scopus. A total of 1,808 Scopus publications cited at least one YouTube video, and there was a steady upward growth in citing online videos within scholarly publications from 2006 to 2011, with YouTube citations being most common within arts and humanities (0.3%) and the social sciences (0.2%). A content analysis of 551 YouTube videos cited by research articles indicated that in science (78%) and in medicine and health sciences (77%), over three fourths of the cited videos had either direct scientific (e.g., laboratory experiments) or scientific-related contents (e.g., academic lectures or education) whereas in the arts and humanities, about 80% of the YouTube videos had art, culture, or history themes, and in the social sciences, about 63% of the videos were related to news, politics, advertisements, and documentaries. This shows both the disciplinary differences and the wide variety of innovative research communication uses found for videos within the different subject areas.

Although journals, conference proceedings, books, and monographs are common primary sources for researchers in many subject areas, nonstandard electronic media seem to be increasingly used in research and education. About a decade ago, critical changes in electronic scholarly communication already had led to “scholars communicat[ing] with each other for informal conversations, for collaborating locally and over distances, for publishing and disseminating their work, and for constructing links between their work and that of others” (Borgman & Furner, 2002 , pp. 3–4). The Web thus has provided new opportunities for publicizing and sharing a wide range of nonstandard scientific content, but much is public and may therefore be studied for evidence of online scholarly communication changes (see Barjak, 2006 ; Fry & Talja, 2007 ). Online videos, for instance, may be useful for scholarly communication within the arts and humanities since human motion is fundamental in some visual and performing arts (e.g., dance, theater, and film). Online videos also may be useful in areas of science where records of complex laboratory demonstrations, science documentaries, or academic lectures might more effectively communicate scientific experiences than would prose. For example, there are advantages to using video “to communicate scientific methods, protocols and results” and to publicize “educational and outreach programmes” (Pasquali, 2007 , p. 712).

Established in 2005, YouTube is a video-sharing Web site for public use and is the third-most-visited Web site after Google and Facebook (Alexa, 2012 ). According to the site owners, “Over 4 billion [YouTube] videos are viewed a day” (YouTube, 2012b ). Although YouTube is predominantly used for entertainment such as music and comedy (see YouTube, 2012, Charts), some academics have used videos to record and publicize their scholarly related activities online (e.g., scientific experiments, conference presentations, or course lectures) almost since YouTube began. For instance, a conference keynote talk by Stephen Hawking about the universe ( youtube.com/watch?v=xjBIsp8mS-c ) has been viewed online about 2.5 million times, and an MIT course lecture on physics ( youtube.com/watch?v=PmJV8CHIqFc ) has been viewed just under 1 million times, both according to YouTube's internal statistics. As a different kind of example, the Journal of Number Theory has a YouTube Channel ( youtube.com/user/JournalNumberTheory )for video presentations of research published in the journal. Hence, authors can create their own videos to explain complex mathematics. The journal directs potential readers using links in article abstracts.

Several studies have previously conducted nonconventional bibliometric analyses on the Web. The types of nonstandard contents analyzed include PowerPoint presentations, blog mentions, and course syllabi (see Kousha & Thelwall, 2008 ; Kousha, Thelwall, & Rezaie, 2010 ) as well as online reference manager sites (Li, Thelwall, & Giustini, 2012 ). One recent study also has classified the contents, types, and subject areas of popular YouTube videos tweeted by scientists to identify the overall purpose of the videos, finding popular science to be common (Thelwall, Kousha, Weller, & Puschmann, in press ). Nevertheless, there seem to be no studies of the use of YouTube videos in published academic research. In particular, this investigation examines what kinds of YouTube videos are formally cited in academic publications and assesses disciplinary differences in the scholarly use of online videos in the sciences, medicine, social sciences, and arts and humanities.

Although it seems that no previous research has examined citations to YouTube videos from academic publications, many studies have covered potential uses of YouTube videos in education (for reviews, see Jones & Cuthrell, 2011 ) and as a data set for scientific research (discussed later). Perhaps closest to the current article, one study has conducted a content analysis of 100 YouTube videos randomly selected from a set tweeted by 563 scientists to assess the contents, types, and subject areas of the tweeted videos (Thelwall et al., in press ). Six categories were used to reflect the overall purposes of the videos: scientific demonstration, public dissemination, education, talks to academics, information about scientists, and comedy. Videos were included only if they were “produced by or based upon an identifiable academic or academic institution” (Thelwall et al., in press ), excluding most entertainment videos, for example. The most viewed videos targeted research-related information at the general public or at the informed general public. However, the study did not assess whether any of the videos were cited in academic publications.

Most studies about academic uses of YouTube videos have focused on educational applications or have used YouTube videos as a data set for scientific research in specific areas (e.g., medicine, public health, marketing), although a few have investigated YouTube itself (e.g., Cheng, Liu, & Dale, in press ; Snelson, Rice, & Wyzard, 2012 ; Thelwall, Sud, & Vis, 2012 ).
YouTube in Academic Education

Many academics are now using YouTube for recording and disseminating course lectures. These videos may be valuable when instructors are away or for students who miss the classes (see also Pasquali, 2007 ). Moreover, these videos also can be viewed by other potential users worldwide. For instance, a survey of 24 health educators in the United States in 2007 revealed that about 42% used YouTube videos in their courses as a resource for academic teaching (Burke, Snyder, & Rager, 2009 , p. 5). Another survey of 232 college agriculture staff revealed that 27% and 25% of the instructors who were members of the American Association for Agricultural Education used video-sharing sites such as YouTube in their classes for assignments and discussion, respectively (Settle et al., 2011 , p. 80). Currently, many universities have their own YouTube channels where they deposit videos of course lectures and other educational content online. The YouTube channel of the University of California, Berkeley ( youtube.com/user/UCBerkeley ), for instance, contains over 3,000 lecture videos on different subject areas and has attracted more than 13 million views. One 45-min YouTube video on human biology has been viewed more than 644,000 times on this channel (see youtube.com/watch?v=S9WtBRNydso ), suggesting that online video lectures can have value in higher education.

Personal experiences and potential uses of YouTube videos in academic education have been discussed in women's studies (Hoskins, 2009 ), language learning and teaching (Brook, 2011 ; Muniandy & Veloo, 2011 ), musicology (Cayar, 2011 ), and history (Rees, 2008 ) in the arts and humanities. These issues also have been discussed in engineering (Fernandez et al., 2011 ; Kaw & Garapati, 2011 ), agriculture (Settle et al., 2011 ), computer science (Carlisle, 2010 ), chemistry (Franz, 2012 ), sport sciences (Burden & Parker, 2008 ), dentistry (Knösel, Jung, & Bleckmann, 2011 ), and nursing education (Clifton & Mann, 2011 ), revealing a broad interest within science and medicine.

Despite the many potential uses of YouTube videos to support teaching, there also are concerns about the accuracy of YouTube videos for academic teaching, especially in medicine and public health. There might be misinformation in videos (e.g., Freeman & Chapman, 2007 ; Hossler & Conroy, 2008 ; Pandey, Patni, Singh, Sood, & Singh, 2010 ), and participation from trusted government sources for posting videos has been suggested to guard against this (Sood, Sarangi, Pandey, & Murugiah, 2011 ).
YouTube videos as a scientific data source

Many researchers have used YouTube as a data set for academic research. The topics studied include the accuracy of information in online videos about the H1N1 influenza (Pandey et al., 2010 ) and the diagnosis of infantile spasms (Fat, Doja, Barrowman, & Sell, 2011 ) in medicine, and content analyses of amateur videos from coalition soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan (Andéén-Papadopoulos, 2009 ), insurgency (Rutledge, 2009 ), and jihad-promoting videos (Conway & McInerney, 2008 ). Appendix A summarizes studies that have used YouTube as a data set for qualitative research.

Most previous investigations using YouTube as a data set have conducted a content analysis with a coding system. Hossler and Conroy ( 2008 ) analyzed the contents of 72 videos about tanning bed use and assessed the safety, risks, and benefits of tanning based upon positive, negative, and neutral categories. Other studies have used expert reviewers to examine the contents of videos. For instance, Gooding and Gregory ( 2011 ) conducted an in-depth content analysis on 32 YouTube videos about music therapy based upon a reviewer's judgments with a 16-statement yes/no format. 1

The objective of this investigation is to assess how YouTube videos are cited in academic publications and to test for disciplinary differences in their use. In particular, the focus is on scholarly uses of online videos by categorizing the common topics of the videos cited in academic publications across the sciences, medicine and health sciences, social sciences, and arts and humanities. As is appropriate for the first study of its kind, the following questions address basic aspects of using online videos in research communication:

    RQ1: How frequently are YouTube videos cited in academic publications and has frequency of use declined at any stage since the birth of YouTube (2005–2011)?

    RQ2: What types of YouTube videos are commonly cited in research articles??

    RQ3: Are there significant broad disciplinary differences in citing online videos??

To address the research questions, we extracted URL citations to YouTube videos from academic publications indexed by Scopus from 2005 to 2011 across four broad disciplines: the sciences, medicine and health sciences, social sciences, and arts and humanities. We then viewed a sample of the cited videos and classified their contents using a specially designed classification scheme (described later).
Scopus Citation Search for Online Videos

We used Elsevier's Scopus citation database to locate academic publications citing YouTube videos. We selected Scopus instead of the Thomson-Reuters Web of Science (WoS) because Scopus indexes more peer-reviewed journals (∼18,500 vs. ∼11,000) (Scopus, 2011b ), and the databases have a large overlap (see Gavel & Iselid, 2008 ). Moreover, our initial tests revealed that it was not possible to extract URL citations to YouTube videos (e.g., youtube.com/watch*) from the references of publications indexed by the WoS through the “Cited Reference Search” option. WoS did not index the full bibliographic information of references (including URL citations); therefore, we could not retrieve any URL citations to YouTube videos from the WoS.

For Scopus YouTube citation searches, we entered the common part of the URLs of YouTube videos ( youtube.com/watch ) in the “References” field (REF) in the main Scopus search interface. All URLs for YouTube videos begin with “youtube.com/watch?v=” followed by a unique 11-character ID such as “fuMNRFTxyVA.” Thus, for the aforementioned video, a valid URL would be “ youtube.com/watch?v=fuMNRFTxyVA .” However, we could not use the full common part of the YouTube URLs for videos in the search process because “?” is a predefined proximity search operator in Scopus and replaces a single character anywhere in a word. Consequently, we used the query “youtube.com/watch*” (an asterisk replaces 0 or more characters) instead of “youtube.com/watch?v=” for the main Scopus YouTube citation searches. The more general query “youtube.com*” was not used because it retrieves many broad citations to the YouTube Web site as a Web phenomenon or YouTube channels (e.g., youtube.com/user/bbc ) rather than exclusive URL citations to individual videos.

We restricted our search to four broad subject areas—sciences, medicine and health sciences, social sciences, and arts and humanities—to assess broad disciplinary differences. However, we encountered a few problems in Scopus for refining subject areas. For instance, while Scopus displays several broad subject categories in the “refine results” menu, such as social sciences and medicine, there also are some narrow related classes such as pharmacology, toxicology, and pharmaceutics for medicine as well as business, management & accounting, and psychology for social sciences (Table  2 ). Hence, we merged the broad categories with associated subclasses to have a more representative dataset for a disciplinary analysis. Although Scopus indexes “nearly 3,500 arts and humanities titles” (about 15% of the entire title list in the database) such as “literature, history, architecture and visual and performing arts” from around the world (see Scopus, 2011a ), it does not show these narrow classes in the “refine results” option. Consequently, we used “arts and humanities” as the only available category for arts and humanities videos. Table  2 shows the broad disciplines used throughout the investigation (first column) and the merged subclasses (excluding arts and humanities), as reported in Scopus.
Table 2.  Broad multidisciplinary areas and associated merged Scopus subject classes Broad multidisciplinary area 	Merged subject classes in Scopus

Arts and humanities 	n/a. This category includes literature, history, architecture, and visual and performing arts (see Table  1 ).

We exported all data from Scopus in Excel format on December 20, 2011, and automatically extracted URL citations to YouTube videos through Webometric Analyst's ( lexiurl.wlv.ac.uk ) features devised to mine valid YouTube video IDs from the reference sections of publications. We used this program to remove any incorrect YouTube IDs (e.g., youtube.com/watch=v7kuT ) either from errors in the original papers or as recorded incorrectly by Scopus. Table  3 gives an overview of the numbers involved.

Content Analysis of Cited YouTube Videos

To understand which themes in YouTube videos were commonly used in scientific publications and whether there were disciplinary differences between the broad subject areas, we viewed 551 randomly sampled cited videos from research articles (omitting reviews, conference papers, editorials, letters, and notes) from the Scopus searches (Table  3 ). In many cases, we also read the descriptions of, and some comments on, the YouTube videos (if available) and searched for a lecturer or speaker biography to better understand video contexts.

The first and third authors separately conducted an initial content analysis of the videos based on a primary classification scheme derived from a previous classification of YouTube videos tweeted by academics (Thelwall et al., in press ). To reach a reasonable degree of agreement on the classification procedure, the two coders first cross-checked the categorization process for a sample of 80 videos from different subject areas, discussing the coding of different types of videos. For instance, they modified and extended the initial categories during the coding process because of the existence of broader subject areas of videos in the study (discussed later). Although some categories such as music, dance, theater, movies, comedies, or advertisements were relatively straightforward to classify, we reclassified some types of videos after a third reviewer's comments (the second author) based upon an overview of the categories. In particular, we first assigned one category for documentaries, but subsequently extended it to three classes: “science documentaries,” “arts and humanities documentaries,” and “social science documentaries” to reflect the different contents for documentary videos cited by articles. A similar procedure also was performed for “video talks” on natural or formal sciences, arts and humanities, and social sciences.

A challenging issue was integrating subclasses into broader categories to answer the previously mentioned research questions. We coded the cited videos into three broad categories and 16 subclasses, as shown next. Our broad interpretation of the results can reflect the extent to which cited online videos contained natural or formal scientific themes or other topics which may be important in research communication in the social sciences and in the arts and humanities.
Natural or formal science videos (including medicine and health sciences)

This broad category covers online videos with natural science or formal science (math and logic) themes: demonstrating a particular natural or formal phenomenon, explaining theory underpinning natural or formal phenomena, or describing a scholarly event or experience associated with studying such phenomena (e.g., a scientific conference). This category includes educational and recreational videos as well as academic lectures or speeches mainly for university audiences or informed public audiences in natural or formal science. We used four subclasses to represent online videos with direct scientific or scholarly related contents. Appendix A provides more examples of different types of videos classified in this broad category.

    Demonstration of a natural or formal science phenomenon
    This subclass includes videos with an apparently scientific theme such as a real-time lab experiment in robotics (e.g., “Stereo vision with obstacle avoidance,” ID: MCLUXe9nwcI 1 ), graphical demonstrations in physics (e.g., “Oscillons in hybrid inflation,” ID: SWGgSM0Pacs), and live surgery videos (e.g., “Single incision sleeve gastrectomy,” ID: aN_Oi5hTmVg).
    Natural or formal science documentary
    This subclass includes documentaries (usually with narration and edited with different types of shots) about natural or formal science. Examples include videos about polio in India (ID: HZp1VNr44Bw), oceanography (ID: vym7TQBc-TE), virology (ID: nCJdws9CnUw), and plastic surgery (ID: 1DPaqGLVv2I).
    Natural or formal science education or hobby
    Although any scientific video can potentially be used for education, some videos may be specifically created for teaching (for an engineering initiative, see Kaw & Garapati, 2011 ). Examples include a training video for air sampling (ID: xi8xdqJWviM) and tutorials on using a spectrophotometer, both of which were cited by the Journal of Chemical Education (ID: GNPfssmPbWA), and in medicine, instructions for using the Bengmark naso-intestinal tube (ID: HUv13Xy0GwE) was cited by Nutrition in Clinical Practice . Some videos were apparently made by hobbyists, but with a potential science instructional application, such as “Big Outdoor Soap Bubbles∼Recipe & How To Do” (ID: gQmpVIgDvgQ) cited by Advances in Colloid and Interface Science . Nevertheless, sometimes it was difficult to decide whether videos were designed to be educational or entertainment, such as “Brainiac science abuse—Can you smell fear?” (ID: 57pwxeqOmQs), which is an extract from a U.K. science-based comedy television show. For such cases, we also looked at the citing journals to assess the educational utility of the cited videos.
    Natural or formal science academic lectures
    This group includes natural or formal science lectures, speeches, and talks by academics in conferences (e.g., ID: o5RbyK0m5OY), seminars (e.g., ID: hVimVzgtD6w), and other academic meetings or discussions, typically to disseminate research to other scholars in the same area. As an example in medicine and health sciences, a 30-min academic lecture video “Sugar: The Bitter Truth” (ID: dBnniua6-oM) by a professor of clinical pediatrics was cited by a research article published in the Journal of the American Dietetic Association . In a few cases, scientific talks were captured outside the conference or seminar format, such as in nature (“Oak Wilt in New York” by Cornell University, ID: XVUZsvyZfVE), in computing/IT exhibitions (e.g., “IDF SF08: Parallels & Intel Virtualization for Directed I/O,” ID: EiqMR5Wx_r4), or even through only slides and narrations without a “talking head” (“CMS/MIPPA accreditation mandates for 2012 by American College of Radiology,” ID: 9f46Akv-78I).

Arts and humanities (including art, media, culture, and history)

Our initial classification exercise found many videos cited by journal articles in the arts and humanities with an artistic entertainment theme such as music, dance, theater, comedy, movies, and animations. These videos may help research communication within their own fields. For instance, a ballet could be a major scholarly output and hence a YouTube video of it would be the equivalent of a video of a scientific experiment in the natural sciences. Moreover, in many humanities subject areas such as history and cultural studies, documentaries are an important scholarly output, and historical events captured on video also can be used as evidence to support or illustrate a scholarly argument. For instance, a comparison between YouTube videos and the National Film and Sound Archive (NFSA) for old Australian television programs indicated that YouTube has “more surprising pieces of rare ephemera” which can be a useful reference for historical research (McKee, 2011 , p. 154).

This broad category is for all videos with an arts and humanities theme, regardless of whether the videos were created by recognized academics. This is analogous to the inclusion of amateur science and natural phenomena within the first broad category. Appendix B shows examples of videos classified in this category.

    Music
    This class includes music videos or live singing performances. They were mostly cited by music journals such as the Journal of Musicological Research (“SHINDIG,” ID: NIcIsVKmmRY), Leonardo Music Journal (“Air piano,” ID: EA90JC9PUKg), and theater and drama journals ( Contemporary Theatre Review , ID: 9EbQs2yKts8).
    Dance and theater
    This class includes videos of performing arts, including dance (e.g., ballet) and plays. Most citations were either from dance journals such as Dance Chronicle (ID: vkgWoXTYo3o) and Dance Research (ID: FkZhDcB-OfA) or music journals such as Musicology Australia (ID: D2LKAl3tfXg) and Nineteenth Century Music (ID: EMyk67l5ico).
    Movies and animations
    This class includes complete movies and animations or extracts from longer movies. Most citations to movie parts appeared in film and literature review journals such as the Quarterly Review of Film and Video (ID: yqi_C2vOars) and Review—Literature and Arts of the Americas (ID: B3rRkCJbK0E). One interesting example is George Orwell's “1984” complete film (ID: hATC_2I1wZE) produced in 1954 in black and white and cited by Literature and History .
    Comedy
    Humorous videos are important on YouTube (see youtube.com/comedy ). This class includes amateur comedy videos—apparently designed to be funny—but not extracts from television shows (e.g., “Chav Hunting,” ID: N9_YhKbrhnY, cited by Paedagogica Historica ). Humor is in this category both as a type of light entertainment and because humor research falls within the humanities subject area. Comedy videos were not cited by humor research in our sample but were cited for a variety of other reasons. For instance, a comedy video about physician assistant training (ID: aX7jme2b0N0) was cited in an article entitled “Teaching Medicine to Millennials” published in the Journal of Physician Assistant Education .
    Television shows
    This category includes previously broadcast television shows available via YouTube. These are included in the arts and humanities broad category because they primarily serve an entertainment purpose. For instance, a television show video “Ashton Kutcher beats CNN in Twitter contest to reach 1 million followers” (ID: iIuJvcclLxs) was cited by Reference Services Review , and a short public television interview with director Spike Lee was cited by the Journal of Homosexuality. This category excludes news and television documentaries .
    Arts and humanities documentaries
    This category covers documentaries with artistic, historical, or cultural themes. For instance, documentaries about Sanford Meisner, a famous American actor and acting teacher (ID: zNuFSrsYfpM), Julian Voss-Andreae, a German American contemporary sculptor (ID: LqsQYVFAgPo), and Akira Kurosawa, a prominent Japanese film director (ID: G1STFM39vJ4) were cited by Theatre, Dance and Performance Training , Leonard , and Theoretical Inquiries in Law, respectively. This class also includes documentaries with historical themes. For instances, a black-and-white narrative clip about Britain in the 1970s (ID: qyW7jHjZrrk) and a historical film capturing Thomas Edison in Paris in 1900 (ID: CNuoruvYzMs) were cited by the History Workshop Journal and Early Popular Visual Culture , respectively. Two videos about the history of science, “The History of Autism” (ID: VaZUig03gT0) and “First Video Game?” (ID: u6mu5B-YZU8), seemed more related to the history and philosophy of science rather than to science itself. Thus, we also classified them in this category.
    Arts and humanities speeches (including academic talks)
    This category is for talks by artists, philosophers, historians, literary figures, religious people, and academics in the arts and humanities. For instance, a speech by Teofan Arhiepiscop (ID: 9YdTkrfmxz0) was cited by the Journal for the Study of Religions and Ideologies , an Emmy acceptance speech by actress Sally Field (ID: ImoMGyJjWIk) was cited by The Drama Review—A Journal of Performance Studies, a talk by choreographer Wally Cardona (ID: cqzDoxujPVk) was cited by Dance Chronicle , and a speech by English writer and novelist Alan Moore (ID: BrBbeBezezw) was cited by the Journal of Graphic Novels and Comics .

Social sciences (including political sciences and marketing)

Some of the cited videos seemed to relate primarily to social science subject areas, mainly political sciences, communication studies, and marketing and business. These videos seem to have some connection to academic subjects in social sciences, such as news reports and political speeches to journalism and communication studies or commercials and advertisements videos to marketing and business. Appendix C shows examples of different types of videos classified in this category.

    News, correspondents’ reports, and amateur news videos
    This subclass includes different types of news pieces , live correspondents’ reports and interviews such as The Wall Street Journal report on the financial crisis (ID: _mzcbXi1Tkk), an NBC report on looting by the police after Hurricane Katrina (ID: NmQW6xLECUU) and a CNN interview with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger (ID: TnIu9AffqX4). This category also includes amateur videos by members of the public or citizen journalists from newsworthy events across the world, such as the September 11 attack on the Twin Towers (ID: K8dX3foxozQ), which was cited by research about media convergence and surveillance published in Convergence .
    Advertisements
    This category covers videos that are essentially advertisements. For instance, the “dove evolution” (ID: iYhCn0jf46U) and “iPod Touch” (ID: KKQUZPqDZb0) advertisements were cited by the marketing and business journals Journal of Database Marketing and Customer Strategy Management and Business Horizons , respectively .
    Politics, activism, and business
    This category includes talks by politicians, political talks by nonpoliticians such as activists, and talks by business managers. We found many speeches by politicians (e.g., presidents, leaders, parliament members, judicial members, military officials) referenced by social science journal articles, perhaps because YouTube has become a political-campaigning medium (e.g., Church, 2008 ; Gibson & McAllister, 2011 ). The 2008 U.S. elections, for instance, produced channels “with 220 million views” (Cornfield, 2009 , House p. 214, as cited in May, 2010 , p. 502). In particular, a speech by U.S. President Barack Obama (ID: QkNpUEWIhd4) was cited by the European Journal of Social Sciences , a speech by Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, the Secretary-General of Hezbollah (ID: HalvZUHlenU), was cited by the Arab World Geographer , a speech by U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy (ID: xeQRpNQmWOU) was cited by the Law Library Journal , and an Iranian presidential debate between two key candidates in 2009 (ID: 9DNmR15Lui8) was cited by the Middle East Journal .
    Academic talks by social scientists
    We found a few social science academic lectures. As an example, a lecture by Michael Wesch, professor of cultural anthropology, about social media applications and educational portals of the future (ID: J4yApagnr0s) was cited by the Journal of Adolescent and Adult Literacy , and an academic speech by Michael Fullan, professor emeritus in education (ID: xLgrLwJ3Cf8), was cited by the Journal of Mathematics Teacher Education . Sometimes, it was difficult to recognize lectures as either academic or political. For instance, a speech by Dr. Ronald Ernest (doctor in medicine) about “a constitutional approach to dealing with security threats” (ID: VrCqVYVxEoA) seems to be an academic talk; however, he has a political background (e.g., as a U.S. Representative, candidate for President of the United States, and a Republican). Hence, we classified this case as a talk by a politician.
    Social science documentaries
    This category includes documentaries with social, political, or journalistic themes which deal with social science issues. For instance, documentaries about Marshall McLuhan (ID: faK9HUvH2ck), Omar Khadr's interrogation in Guantanamo Bay detention camp (ID: yNCyrFV2G_0), the early 1980s protests against the Santa Cruz Beauty Pageant (ID: agyEAhwrVUU) , and the bad situation of Romanian children in orphanages (ID: VDR5xpLEx-U) were cited by articles in communication, law, women's studies, and educational research journals, respectively, and were all classified in this category.

Citing and Cited YouTube Videos

Table  3 gives an overview of Scopus publications citing YouTube videos and URL citations to videos in the four subject areas as of December 20, 2011. In general, it shows that 1,808 Scopus publications (e.g., articles, reviews, conference papers, editorials) cited at least one YouTube video in their reference lists. Science with 630 and medicine and health sciences with 212 URL citations to YouTube videos had the highest and lowest number of citations, respectively; however, these are absolute numbers. In the following section, we therefore report the normalized results per publication in each discipline to give a more representative picture of the prevalence of videos in academic publications. Table  3 also reports that about 53% ( n  = 964) of the publications citing YouTube videos were articles, although this varies greatly between disciplines. The fourth column of Table  3 shows the number of sampled articles with at least one valid URL citation to a YouTube video for the subsequent content analysis. The fifth and sixth columns report the total number of URL citations to YouTube videos in the publications and mean YouTube citations per article. For instance, it indicates that 2,382 valid YouTube citations appeared in the reference sections of 1,808 publications indexed by Scopus.
YouTube Citations Over Time

Figure  1 shows that since YouTube was launched to the public in May 2005 (YouTube, 2012a , 2012b ), there has been a consistent upward trend in citing its videos within academic publications. For instance, while we only extracted 3 and 32 Scopus publications citing YouTube videos in 2006 and 2007, respectively, in 2008, 2009, and 2010, the number of academic publications with at least one YouTube video citation increased dramatically to 105, 317, and 632 online videos, respectively, indicating annual growth of about two to three times. Although there also was an increase in the number of publications citing YouTube videos in 2011 (719 videos), this number is an underestimate because the last issues of some journals in the year 2011 may have not been published or indexed by Scopus at the time of data collection: December 20, 2011. Nevertheless, Figure  1 suggests that many academic publications increasingly cite online videos, especially in the arts and humanities and to some extent in the social sciences. Figure  1 also compares the annual growth in the number of publications citing YouTube videos across the four broad disciplines. It shows that although in all areas there are similar upward trends, the absolute number of publications citing YouTube videos in medicine is much lower than that in the other broad disciplines (discussed later).

Publication Types

In the four broad disciplines, the dominant types of sources citing YouTube videos were journal articles (53%), conference papers (24%), reviews (12%), and other types of publications (11%) including editorials, letters, notes, and short surveys. However, there were huge differences between types of sources citing YouTube videos across the broad disciplines (Figure  2 ). For instance, in the social sciences, the majority (77%) of citations to YouTube videos were from journal articles. In contrast, in the sciences, conference papers (63%) were the most common type of citing sources, particularly for computer science (e.g., proceedings of the IEEE or the Association for Computing Machinery) in which authors have more dependency on conference papers than on journal publications (see Bar-Ilan, 2010 ; Moed & Visser, 2007 ).

Figure  2 also shows that in addition to journal articles in the arts and humanities (52%) and medicine and health sciences (56%), there are many YouTube citations from review papers (30 and 20%, respectively). The results show that YouTube videos can be cited in different types of publications.
Normalized Comparison of YouTube Citations

Table  3 reports the absolute numbers of citations to YouTube videos in the four broad subject areas, but it does not disclose the proportion of cited YouTube videos per publication in each broad area. For this reason, ratios were calculated by dividing the number of citing sources as well as citations to YouTube videos by the total number of Scopus publications in each broad area from January 2006 to December 2011. We selected these years for Scopus publications because YouTube launched in May 2005 (YouTube, 2012a ), and we did not find any citations to YouTube videos in Scopus publications before 2006.

Most important, the sixth column of Table  4 shows that the proportion of documents with at least one YouTube citation is much higher in the arts and humanities (0.3%) and social sciences (0.2%) than it is in the sciences (0.01%) and medicine and health sciences (0.006%). Hence, it seems that in social sciences and arts and humanities, online videos are more commonly used in research communication than they are in science and in medicine and health sciences.

Scholarly Contents of Cited YouTube Videos

The overall results of the content analysis of the 551 sampled YouTube videos cited by research articles indexed by Scopus showed that 31% ( n  = 172) were natural or formal science videos whereas 32% ( n  = 174) had art, culture, and history themes (e.g., music, dance, theater, and movie excerpts) and 37% ( n  = 205) had contents related to the social sciences (e.g., news and politics). However, there were huge disciplinary differences across subject areas. Figure  3 provides an overview of types of YouTube videos cited by research papers in the sample across the four subject areas. Most important, it shows that in sciences and in medicine and health sciences, about 78 and 77% of the cited videos had scientific themes, respectively, including demonstrations of a natural or formal science phenomenon, natural or formal science documentaries, natural or formal science education or hobby videos, and natural or formal science academic lectures (see Method section; also discussed later), while only 1% in the arts and humanities and 12% in social sciences of the cited videos had scientific content. One possible explanation for finding relatively many scientific videos in the social sciences is that there were many science education videos from multidisciplinary education journals (9.2%) such as the Journal of Chemical Education and Physics Education , which were indexed in the social sciences by Scopus.

In addition, Figure  3 shows that, in the arts and humanities, 80% of videos had artistic themes. The figure also shows that 63% of the cited videos in the reference lists of social science journal articles were classified in the broad category of social science.

Appendix D gives more details about the percentages of cited YouTube videos based on the 16 subclasses used for the content analysis of the videos. In science, most cited videos (51%) had directly scientific contents, especially those based on demonstrating real-time laboratory experiments in physics (e.g., electric charge sniffer, ID: vAQ64Sv4iqY), chemistry [palladium (Pd) nanoparticles, ID: iEcbHSGHATw], and biology (sexual behavior of insects Themira + Nemopoda, ID: Z1eWftJrU2M). Most important, we found many real-time laboratory experiments in computer science, such as for robotics (e.g., Sony Qrio robot, ID: 9fBIRitTROE) and intelligent and control systems (e.g., CyberC3 intelligent vehicles, ID: 868WDdPRzLI).

Although we also found many scientific videos (∼17%) such as real-time endoscopic surgery (ID: 02EC7rMoSuo), in medicine and health sciences, most videos cited by research articles were documentaries with public health themes (35%), such as documentaries about autism (ID: JnylM1hI2jc) and viral diseases (ID: nCJdws9CnUw). Educational videos seem to be significant for medical education (15%), such as instructions for shoulder examinations (ID: RsTObF8W9Ds) or using a specific medical device such as ultrasound for lung comets (ID: 7y_hUFBHStM). In natural and formal sciences and in medicine and health sciences, 10% of the cited videos were natural or formal science lectures, speeches, and talks by academics at conferences, seminars, and other academic meetings. Perhaps these academic lectures were cited because the contents were never published elsewhere or it was more convenient for the researcher to access the live speeches and talks through YouTube searches.

Performing arts (27%), including music, dance, and theater, and arts and historical documentaries (16%) were the two most common themes of cited videos in arts and humanities. Arts and humanities lectures and talks (12%), movies and animations (10%), comedies (7%), and public television shows (6%) were other themes of videos cited by arts and humanities journal articles, suggesting that in this subject area, wide types of artistic, media, and entertainment outputs also can be valuable for research communication.

In the social sciences, the most common types of cited videos were speeches by politicians and activists (21%), news reports (20%), and documentaries with social, political, or journalism themes (10%) (see Method section). Many of the news-related videos were broadcast by national or international news agencies such as BBC, CNN, and NBC. A wide range of subject areas in the social sciences cited this type of video, from sociology (in Sociological Research Online , ID: UaQMK72FYXs) and communication and media studies (in Communication Studies , ID: 9SDHxaYhqAo) to law (in Louisiana Law Review , ID: NmQW6xLECUU) and psychology (in Journal of Black Psychology , ID: NTixCXmrezY). The results also showed that about 9% of the cited videos in social sciences were advertising videos (e.g., ID: KKQUZPqDZb0), which were commonly cited by marketing and business or law journals (e.g., International Journal of Advertising , Buffalo Law Review ).
Interdisciplinary Uses of Online Videos

In several cases, we found interdisciplinary citations of YouTube videos, such as nonscientific videos being cited by scientific publications. Even art and entertainment videos are sometimes used for scientific discussions in the sciences or medicine and hence cross traditional boundaries between established academic areas. Some journal articles published in the hard sciences and medicine and health sciences cited nonscientific videos, such as music, parts of comedy films, commercials, and public TV shows. For instance, an opera sung by Roberto Alagna (ID: f6urNGBR95w) was cited by an article about acoustics research published in the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America , and a music video by the band Radiohead with 3D plotting technologies (ID: 8nTFjVm9sTQ) was cited in optics engineering research in the journal Optics and Lasers in Engineering . In rare cases, the same interdisciplinary use of videos can be seen for medicine and health sciences. For instance, a dance-performance video (ID: B87kwTqf7lw) was cited in an article about using music and dance for helping Parkinson's disease that was published in the Clinical Nurse Specialist , part of a drama in a hospital (ID: QmX5IQmMt3U) was cited in an article about family medicine and music, and a comedy video (ID: aX7jme2b0N0) was cited in an article about medical education.

In the social sciences and arts and humanities, we also found several cases of interdisciplinary use of YouTube videos in research. For instance, a real-time demonstration of a robot capable of “autonomously folding a pile of towels” (ID: gy5g33S0Gzo) was cited by an article published in the Yale Law Journal about standards of patentability, a video of a 2D monitor for the remote browsing of scanned books and manuscripts (BSB Explorer, ID: qmMMMVnNxLI) was used in a library science paper, a science lecture about climate change and earth system modeling (ID: 8wX1rLqRfNc) was cited by Historical Records of Australian Science , and the “Lady Gaga—Love Game” music video (ID: 1mB0tP1I-14) was cited in a sexology investigation. Moreover, talks by nonacademics can be cited for different reasons. For instance, a press conference by Barack Obama (ID: p4EKY7rCF_c) was cited by the Quarterly Journal of Speech from the perspective of discussing ways of speaking and delivering a public address . Hence, videos potentially can be used by academics in completely different contexts to those imagined by their creators. To give another example, a news-montage comedy video (“Alice in Oblivion,” ID: DypZ7UFvNnk) was cited in a criminology context (Sheptycki, 2009 , p. 331).
Limitations

Although this study may well be the first attempt to assess how YouTube videos are cited in academic publications and to understand the value of online videos in scholarly communication across broad fields, we did not assess the motivations for citing videos in the context of the scientific literature. Thus, a more qualitative study is needed to understand how online videos are used in research communication. For instance, we classified the advertising video “dove evolution” (ID: iYhCn0jf46U) as nonscientific, but are not presenting an analysis of why it was cited by a research article (Southgate, Westoby, & Page, 2010 , p. 362) published in the International Journal of Advertising to support a scholarly discussion about viewing television advertisements online.

Another practical limitation was the complex and subjective issue of coding video contents. We discussed the coding system after the initial classification process and modified it several times to get general agreement. For instance, we first merged television shows and news-related videos into one class, but subsequently split them into two subclasses because shows are more related to arts and humanities whereas the news is more associated with the social sciences (e.g., political science and journalism). Furthermore, some scientific demonstrations also can be used for academic education, and, in rare cases, it was difficult to recognize whether they were created for scientific demonstrations, entertainment, or teaching. We also separated speeches by academics and nonacademics, including arts or humanities speeches and political speeches, based on the descriptive information below each video (e.g., conference name, seminar, university, academic position of speaker), audio information (e.g., introduction of speakers), or visual information in the videos (e.g., university logo or banners in the video shot) to identify the audiences of speakers. However, there is no reason why a nonacademic talk (e.g., a chef, ID: O3AqE0YV4K0) should not be used for scholarly reasons by researchers.

Finally, the method used in this article to identify YouTube citations underestimates their number because videos could be cited without URLs, such as by name or with URLs in footnotes or embedded in the article text rather than in reference lists, and because URLs with errors in them were ignored.

Temporal Trends in Citations to YouTube Videos

Regarding the first research question, we found a steady upward growth in citing online videos within academic publications since YouTube launched in 2005 in nearly all broad fields—from 3 and 32 Scopus publications citing YouTube videos in 2006 and 2007, respectively, to 719 video in 2011, indicating that the academic use of YouTube videos is increasing in scientific publications. It is not clear, however, whether more scientific or scholarly related video contents are being uploaded online or whether authors are increasingly willing to cite YouTube videos. The general trend since 2008 is approximately linear rather than exponential, with the increase in the total number of YouTube citations being 226, 328, and 270 in 2009, 2010, and 2011, respectively (using updated figures from April 2012). Assuming a sigmoid shape for the growth, the increase in YouTube citations seems likely to start to slow down soon, before perhaps even tailing off at a stable value.
Common Types of YouTube Videos Cited by Articles

Regarding the second research question, the content analysis of the sampled YouTube videos cited by research articles showed that in science and in medicine and health sciences, the majority of the cited videos (∼78 and 77%, respectively) had a direct scientific theme. However, art, culture, and history videos (∼80%) in the arts and humanities and news contents, advertisements, social documentaries, and talks by politicians (63%) in the social sciences also were commonly cited.
Disciplinary Differences in Citing Online Videos

Regarding the third research question, the results showed significant broad disciplinary differences in citing online videos. Most important, half of the cited videos in the sciences were real-time demonstrations of a particular scientific phenomenon, object, or lab experiment in subjects such as computing, physics, chemistry, and biology. In medicine and health sciences, one third of the cited videos were documentaries with medical or public health themes. In contrast, in the arts and humanities, hardly any videos had a direct scientific theme (1%), and almost half of the cited videos (45%) were related to visual and performing arts (37%) such as music, dance, theater, movie excerpts, and comedies, suggesting that online videos are valuable in some arts and humanities fields where human movement and performances are important and perhaps difficult to fully describe in text. In the social sciences, about 40% of the cited videos related to politics (e.g., news reports and talks by politicians), perhaps because they can potentially be an object of study in political science and world studies and because many political videos can be easily accessed through YouTube.

One unexpected feature of YouTube is its potential for interdisciplinary citations. For instance, music, dance, and movie excerpts may be cited by research papers in the hard sciences for scientific reasons. Further qualitative investigations into motivations for citing YouTube videos may give a clearer understanding of the importance of this aspect of YouTube use. For example, a contextual analysis of citations to YouTube videos in full-text publications could reveal in more detail how YouTube videos are used across disciplines to support scholarly arguments.

Two drawbacks of YouTube citations are that they take time to make and that article readers may not value them because they are not peer-reviewed. Future research could perhaps explore these two issues through a cost–benefit analysis and a study of reader or referee perceptions of YouTube citations.

Finally, in terms of the overall influence of YouTube on academic publications, it seems that YouTube videos are being used by a small, but increasing, number of researchers to support discussions; however, it is not known whether this is because more videos are available online or because scholars are more willing to use online videos for research communication. This particularly occurs in the arts and humanities (where 0.3% of articles cited YouTube videos) and social sciences (where 0.2% of articles cited YouTube videos). These citations seem to give academics two different types of advantage. They can take advantage of video to better describe their research, for instance, by filming a performance (typically moving images with music or dialog, sometimes essentially just music) or an experiment (typically moving images with an audio explanation). Alternatively, researchers can better support their arguments by drawing upon previously ephemeral or hard-to-access sources of evidence such as videos of real-life events (often primarily video) or others’ talks (essentially audio). In both cases, academics are using online multimedia to extend their ability to communicate their arguments or findings through YouTube citations, although readers should perhaps take a more critical attitude toward YouTube sources than toward peer-reviewed sources. Hence, it seems that YouTube is genuinely enhancing scholarly communication, albeit in a minority of cases and mainly in the social sciences and the arts and humanities, and that wider groups of scholars would be advised to consider whether YouTube also can enhance their publications. While some scholars may not need to use YouTube videos to support their papers, others may not use such multimedia resources because of the lack of peer review and because they are unaware that it the practice has become acceptable in some scholarly areas.
