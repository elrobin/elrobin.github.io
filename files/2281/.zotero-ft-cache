Abstract

There has been a steady and rapid growth of academic literature and policy debate on the broad ranging changes of the universities in the Western world. These are mostly founded on two problematic assumptions. One of these is the assumption of ‘unity of object’ whereby ‘the university’ has undergone an institutional dislocation and ‘fragmented’ into a plethora of quite different organizations. Interestingly, these organizations vary not only across national landscapes but also within the same funding landscape. The second problematic assumption is the one about the universality of the pressures for change. This reflects a failure to distinguish between ‘policies’ and ‘policy instruments’, on the one hand, and ‘pressures for change’ on the other. Policies can be possibly be construed as ‘universal’; ‘pressures for change’ are always specific for a social actor, or group of actors, since these are shaped by the policy as well as by the way in which it is interpreted depending on specific positioning and circumstances.. In this chapter these assumptions are challenged using information from a study of university change in the United Kingdom in two universities (a research intensive university and a teaching intensive university). Findings show that the pressures for change, as well as the manifestations of this change, are quite different. As a result these universities have positioned themselves entirely differently, thus leading for specific change in the nature of research and research practices.
