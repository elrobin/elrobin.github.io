Abstract

This article deals with the scientific performance of the European Union (EU) in what is now perhaps the most important enabling technology worldwide: information and communication technologies (ICT). The performance measures are based on the stock and flows of scientific knowledge embodied in research papers published in international scientific and technical journals. Quantitative data derived from these papers are used to examine and compare the performance of the EU science base with the US and Japan—two leading scientific nations in ICT research, and major competitors in ICT industries. These bibliometric indicators characterize and compare these three ICT research bases in terms of research output, international scientific quality, transnational knowledge flows, and domestic and international cooperation patterns. The analysis focuses on the key issue whether or not these data bear evidence of the perceived `European Paradox' which is, among others, characterized by a strong EU public sector science base coupled to a relatively weak R&D performance of EU firms. The findings provide empirical confirmation for the existence of this Paradox in both ICT research domains under investigation: computers and data processing, and telecommunications.
