Abstract

Abstract   We examine the assumptions and data base used by researchers who have tested the Ortega hypothesis. We find that the assumptions are not supported by the data and that the data are faulty. We conclude that the results are artifactual. We recommend that any policy implemented on the basis of this research be suspended.
