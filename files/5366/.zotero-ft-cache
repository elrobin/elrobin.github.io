Performance indicators and, on their basis, performance profiles are one of the foundations of performance analysis in sports. Obviously, the crux is to develop performance profiles which allow to evaluate the subjects of interest accurately. The present paper contributes a further approach to the existing toolbox of profiling methods. Performance profiles based on archetypal athletes are not based on typical, i.e., mean, performances but on extreme performances—usually the most interesting aspect in sports. Archetypal athletes (outstanding—positive and/or negative—performers) are computed and performers are related to these archetypal athletes. As the archetypal athletes are interpretable, an easy interpretation of the performers' profiles follows. The method is demonstrated on basketball statistics and soccer skill ratings.
