Highlights

•

    We present a heterogenous n-mode method.
•

    The method is based on attribute matrices.
•

    We illustrate the method using the Brugada syndrome as a scientific field as our case study.
•

    The n-mode method can be applied to socio-semantic network analysis.

Abstract

The sciences develop as conglomerates of ideas, texts, and agents. In this study, we propose a n-mode network approach to integrate the network matrices containing social, semantic, and epistemic attributes analytically into a single network and visualization. For example, authors, words (e.g., title words and keywords), and knowledge claims can be attributed to publications as units of analysis. This results in a 2-mode document/attributes matrix which stores both the dimensionality in the data and the interaction terms. Multiplication of this matrix by its transposed provides an affiliations matrix which can be decomposed in specific combinations such as socio-semantic networks. The methodology is illustrated by using the Brugada Syndrome as a specialty in the medical sciences. The proposed n-mode network approach can be extended beyond scientific data; a dynamic extension would allow us to model co-evolutions in more than two dimensions. The proposed approach can be applied to a wide array of studies, such as socio-semantic network analysis or heterogenous networks in actor-network theory.

Dr Iina Hellsten is an Associate Professor at the Amsterdam School of Communication Research ASCoR at the University of Amsterdam. Her research mainly focuses on the dynamics of public debates, and socio-semantic networks in social media.

Dr. Tobias Opthof is an electrophysiologist, specialized in research about cardiac arrhythmias, in particular those related to myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, and heart failure. During the period 1995–2002 he was (associate) editor of Cardiovascular Research. As a journal editor, he developed an interest in bibliometrics and citation analysis.

Professor emeritus, Dr. Loet Leydesdorff is affiliated to the Amsterdam School of Communication Research at the University of Amsterdam. His research focuses on STS and scientometrics.
