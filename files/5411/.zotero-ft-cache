Abstract

Recently, the abundance of digital data is enabling the implementation of graph-based ranking algorithms that provide system level analysis for ranking publications and authors. Here, we take advantage of the entire Physical Review publication archive (1893–2006) to construct authors’ networks where weighted edges, as measured from opportunely normalized citation counts, define a proxy for the mechanism of scientific credit transfer. On this network, we define a ranking method based on a diffusion algorithm that mimics the spreading of scientific credits on the network. We compare the results obtained with our algorithm with those obtained by local measures such as the citation count and provide a statistical analysis of the assignment of major career awards in the area of physics. A website where the algorithm is made available to perform customized rank analysis can be found at the address http://www.physauthorsrank.org.

    Figure 1
    Figure 1
    (Color online) Projection of the PCN into a WACN. (a) In the network of citations between papers, the article i , written by two authors i 1 and i 2 , cites two papers j and k , written by one author j 1 and two co-authors k 1 and k 2 , respectively. (b) The WACN is then simply generated by connecting with a directed link both i 1 and i 2 to j 1 , each with weight of 1/2, and to k 1 and k 2 , each with weight of 1/4. Reuse & Permissions
    Figure 2
    Figure 2
    (Color online) We generated the citation network based on all papers published in PR journals about the topic “complex networks.” For clarity, only links with weight above a certain threshold have been plotted. As a consequence only top physicists in this field are shown. The width of each connection is proportional to its weight and the size of the nodes is proportional to the sum of all weights of incident links. Reuse & Permissions
    Figure 3
    Figure 3
    (Color online) In the main plot, the total number of authors N t o t (yellow circles), number of authors with outstrength larger than zero N ( s o u t > 0 ) = ∑ j θ ( s j o u t ) (green squares) and number of authors with instrength larger than zero N ( s i n > 0 ) = ∑ j θ ( s j i n ) (red diamonds) are plotted as functions of the number of references (referenced papers), where θ ( ⋅ ) is the step function equal to one when its argument is larger than zero and null otherwise. In the inset the same quantities as those of the main plot are considered, but now they are plotted as functions of time. More specifically, each x value corresponds to the average publication year of papers belonging to the respective dynamical slice of the main plot. Reuse & Permissions
    Figure 4
    Figure 4
    (Color online) Probability densities for the indegree (a) and the instrength (b). Calculations have been performed on different WACNs based on papers published in different periods of time (yellow circles, 1893–2006; red squares, 1893–1966; and gray diamonds 2005). The insets show the same distribution as in the main plots, but opportunely rescaled by their average values. Reuse & Permissions
    Figure 5
    Figure 5
    (Color online) Evolution of the relative rank expressed as top percentile of four Nobel laureates: “Bethe, HA” (1967, black solid line), “Anderson, PW” (1977, red dotted line), “Wilson, KG” (1982, blue solid line), and “De Gennes, PG” (1992, yellow dashed line). Scientific merit is quantified by using Eq. ( 4 ), which counts the author’s percentile as the relative number of authors with better rank than the considered scientist. The figure shows how relative rank is related in time with the Nobel prize (date of the award indicated by the symbol). The diagram reports the entire scientific career of the awardees with the only exception of “Bethe, HA,” whose activity began much earlier than that of the other three scientists. Reuse & Permissions
    Figure 6
    Figure 6
    (Color online) Scatter plots of SARA rank versus CC rank [(a) and (b)] and BCC rank [(c) and (d)]. Plots in (a) and (c) refer to the author citation network based on papers published between 1893 and 1966, while plots in (b) and (d) have been generated by using the author citation network based on papers published in 2005. In all insets, the same data as the ones analyzed in the respective main plots have been logarithmically binned. For each bin we plot maximum and minimum values (error bars), 90% confidence intervals (boxes) and median (horizontal bars inside boxes) of the SARA rank. In all plots, outlier points stress the most significant differences between SARA and the other techniques. Authors badly ranked in CC or BCC methods and well classified in SARA are generally very prominent physicists. By looking at figures (a) and (c) for example, we see scientists of the caliber of “Jordan, P” and “Weyl, H” occupy the top positions in SARA ranking, while their ranks are two orders of magnitude smaller according to CC or BCC methods. On the other hand, the majority of authors poorly ranked by the SARA technique and well ranked by CC method correspond to poorly defined identifiers referring in general to multiple physical persons [see figure (b)]: names such as “Li, J” or “Yu, Z” are very common in China and for this reason their CC score is very high; SARA differently is able to capture the low-scientific relevance of all these authors, ranking them at positions about three orders of magnitude higher than the ones obtained with the CC method.

    Figure 7
    Figure 7
    (Color online) We consider some of the main prizes in Physics (Nobel prize, Wolf prize, Boltzmann medal, Dirac medal, and Planck medal). To each prize, we associate the best performance of the scientist who earned that honor. The performance of an author at a given time is quantified by the author’s percentile defined as the percentage of other authors who have a better rank at the same time [see Eq. ( 4 )]: the lower is this percentage, the better is the performance of the considered scientist. SARA is more predictive than both CC and BCC: according to SARA ranking, the 35% of the prizes have been assigned to scientists who have reached a position below the 0.1%. The SARA tells that 77% of the considered honors have been earned by scientists with a best performance rank lower than 1%. As term of comparison, according to CC and BCC ranking the former rate decreases to 66% and 67%, respectively. Reuse & Permissions
    Figure 8
    Figure 8
    (Color online) We consider only the IDs of authors with full version of their first names. Then, we count the number of times d the same ID is obtained from authors with different first names (plus middle names, if present). The probability P ( d ) (plotted as yellow circles) of finding an ID with “degeneracy” in the first name equal to d has a power law decay as d increases (the dashed line has exponent equal approximately to − 3 ).

    Figure 9
    The rankings calculated with SARA for q = 0.1 are plotted as function of the rankings obtained with the same algorithm but for different values of q : (a) q = 0.01 , (b) q = 0.15 and (c) q = 0.3 . All plots have been generated from the WACN based on all papers published between 1893 and 1966 [the same data set as the one used in Figs. 6a, 6c of the main text]. Reuse & Permissions
    Figure 10
    Figure 10
    (Color online) Percentage of prizes earned by physicists who have reached a given rank position as their best performance. Generally, the SARA is more predictive than the simple CC criterion since top scientists in SARA ranking have higher chances to earn a prize than top authors in the analogous ranking based on CC.
