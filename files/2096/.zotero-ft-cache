These remarks introduce the book, not Kuhn and his life work. He usually
referred to the book as Structure, and in conversation simply as “the book.” I
follow his usage. The Essential Tension is a superb collection of philosophical (

The book launched a fleet ofbooks about Kuhn's life and work. An excellent short
introduction to the work of Thomas Samuel Kuhn (1922–94), with a different slant
from this one, is to be found in the online Stanford Encyclopedia ofPhilosophy.3  ...

The queen of the sciences, then, was physics. Kuhn had been trained as a
physicist. Few people knew much physics, but everybody knew that physics was
where the action was. A cold war was in progress, so everyone knew about the
Bomb.

Francis Bacon was its prophet, Galileo its lighthouse, and Newton its sun. A first
point to notice—one that is not immediately obvious on a first skimming of
Structure—is that Kuhn was not talking about the scientific revolution. That was
quite a  ...

Immense experimental or instrumental novelty is simply missed in Kuhn's
theoretical stance, so normal science may have a great deal of novelty, just not
theoretical. And for the general public, which wants technologies and cures, the

I shall come back to local and global but first some recapturing. Nowadays
paradigm, along with its companion paradigm shift, is embarrassingly
everywhere. When Kuhn wrote, few people had ever encountered it. Soon it
became trendy.

Berkeley, he had many a conversation with Stanley Cavell, a fascinatingly
original thinker who was deeply immersed in Wittgenstein. Each acknowledged

Kuhn became increasingly interested in events much smaller in scope, which
pertained to small communities of workers. There are very large scientific
communities—genetics, or condensed-matter (solid-state) physics, for example.

Anomaly (§VI) The full title of this section is “Anomaly and the Emergence of
Scientific Discoveries.” Section VII has a parallel title: “Crisis and the Emergence
of Scientific Theories.” These odd pairings are integral to Kuhn's account of
science.
Page xxvii
Crisis (§§VII–VIII) Crisis and theory change also go hand in hand. Anomalies
become intractable. No amount of tinkering will fit them into established science.
But Kuhn is adamant that this does not, in itself, lead to rejection of existing theory
.
Page xxviii
Kuhn wanted to say something more interesting. After a revolution, scientists, in
the field that has been changed, work in a different world. The more cautious
among us will say that is just a metaphor. Speaking literally, there is just one
world,  ...
Page xxix
