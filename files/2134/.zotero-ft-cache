    Article metrics

Transparency, education and communication are key to ensuring that appropriate metrics are used to measure individual scientific achievement.

The use of metrics to measure and assess scientific performance is a subject of deep concern, especially among younger scientists. In this issue, Nature begins what we hope will be an ongoing conversation on such measures and how they should be developed and used. All the metrics-related articles are collected at http://www.nature.com/metrics and are available for online comment.

A poll of Nature 's readers suggests that feelings about metrics are mixed ( see page 860 ). Many researchers say that, in principle, they welcome the use of quantitative performance metrics because of the potential for clarity and objectivity. Yet they also worry that the hiring, promotion and tenure committees that control their fate will ignore crucial but hard-to-quantify aspects of scientific performance such as mentorship and collaboration building, and instead focus exclusively on a handful of easy-to-measure numbers related mostly to their publication and citation rates.

    “Administrators need to understand what the various metrics can and cannot tell them.”

Academic administrators contacted by Nature suggest that this fear may be exaggerated. Most institutions seem to take a gratifyingly nuanced approach to hiring and tenure decisions, relying less on numbers and more on wide-ranging, qualitative assessments of a candidate's performance made by experts in the relevant field.

Yet such enlightened nuancing cannot be taken for granted. Numbers can be surprisingly seductive, and evaluation committees need to guard against letting a superficial precision undermine their time-consuming assessment of a scientist's full body of work. This is particularly true in countries such as Britain, where metrics-heavy national assessments of universities can trickle down, so that individuals feel more rewarded for quantity than for quality — and change their behaviour to match.

New measures of scientific impact are being developed all the time ( see page 864 ), in part driven by government agencies looking to quantify the results they are getting for their investment. Such innovation is to be encouraged. But researchers must be mindful of how and why the metrics they are making are being used. When one person in this field was interviewed by Nature , he expressed a keen interest in reading our News Feature on how metrics are used for individual assessment, and to what extent, because he had no evidence with which to answer these questions himself. This isn't an optimal situation, to put it mildly. There needs to be much more discussion between specialists such as social scientists, economists and scientometricians to ensure that metrics development goes hand-in-hand with a discussion of what the metrics are for, and how they are affecting people. Only then can good suggestions be made about how to improve the system (see page 870 ).

Academic administrators, conversely, need to understand what the various metrics can and cannot tell them. Many measures — including the classic 'impact factor' that attempts to describe a journal's influence — were not designed to assess individual scientists. Yet people still sometimes try to apply them in that way. Given that scientometricians continue to devise metrics of ever-increasing sophistication, universities and scientific societies need to help decision-makers keep abreast. Setting a good example is the European Summer School for Scientometrics, a programme that is being inaugurated in Berlin on 16–18 June and will run in Vienna from 2011. It promises a science-based approach to tutoring on the merits and pitfalls of various metrics.

Institutions must also ensure that they give their researchers a clear and complete picture of how assessments are made. This can be awkward — one dean said that he was reluctant to list the qualities he looked for in tenure applications because this could encourage list-ticking behaviour rather than innovation in his faculty. But transparency is essential: no matter how earnestly evaluation committees say that they are assessing the full body of a scientist's work, not being open about the criteria breeds the impression that a fixed number of publications is a strict requirement, that teaching is undervalued and that service to the community is worthless. Such impressions do more than breed discontent — they alter the way that scientists behave. To promote good science, those doors must be opened wide.

        First you identify and rate the strengths of the variables, then you do the metrics. We constantly get the metric cart before the variable horses. Major variables are documented in my text_Tomorrow's Cures Today? How to Reform the Health Research System_ (2000) and in my peer-review webpages

        No assessment is perfect, be it quantitatively or qualitatively.

        Apart from transparency which is a must in research evaluation or performance appraisal, assessment via the triangulation method would be a more appropriate and reliable procedure.

        There will always be an element of subjectivity no matter how objective one wishes to be. Nevertheless, assessment done by a group of experts would certainly be better than by an individual.

        Editor is very right in his/her concern that scientist should not be judged by number of publications. As in country like India where relationship matter most, scientists increase number of publications by giving each other names in their publications based on relationship/friendship rather than on the basis of their scientific contributions.As science has become team work bigger a team scientist has more will be number of publications. Hence we should not judge a scientists only on the basis of no. of scientific publications.Present metrics based assessment system should specially take these points into consideration.

        I have had some experience with metrics and one of the most difficult points for most persons is to have a model of the discipline and its vision, once the vision for success of the science is established then, and only then, can metrics be defined and measurements taken. Metrics are very dependent on the model of the discipline and what success means.

        Edward Medeiros, above, has hit the nail on the head. Some twenty years ago I made an Attainment Curve for Chemical Engineering in the UK by putting all the Professors in rank order of citations [in reputable chemical engineering journals] to their work published anywhere. This provides a measure of what may be expected in a particular discipline in a particular country at a particular time. This permitted me to comment on the results of those peer review committees distributing money and evaluating research in chemical engineering. The curve might be used by a young academic wishing to know if he has got what it takes to [really] succeed.
        I used these results in a submission to government in 2006 about metrics "The management of university research in the intellectual age". This paper is on my web site academic-research.co.uk.
        I agree that citations cannot be used to make a precise comparison of researchers but they can show whether a researchers work is worth reading. [An analogy is comparing Mozart with Beethoven with Brahms and so on, which is pointless but they are all worth listening to.]

        Can metrics drive science?

        Nevertheless the unquestionable importance of the research evaluation metrics and other assessment methodos, the last special issue of Nature on science metrics stimulated us to write this short essay to show how some very important points are still not being considered yet. Although not being able to suggest how to achieve the best research, hopefully this short record my contribute to enrich the discussion on this matter.

        (Re-)Discovering endooligopeptidaseA (EOPA)/NudeL/Ndel1
        In early 70?s two novel peptidases, coined as oligopeptidases due to the selective hydrolysis of small peptides, was discovered in mammalian brain by a group of Brazilian scientists (1, 2). Since then, a number of oligopeptidases has been described. One of these is the endooligopeptidase A (EOPA), whose cDNA was cloned from rabbit and human brain libraries and the respective sequences were first deposited in 1997 and 1999, respectively (GenBank Acc. numbers AF015037/AAB99905 and AF217798). Hereupon, the sequence of rabbit brain EOPA was published in February of 2000 (3).
        In the December issue of 2000, Neuron published a minireview and three articles describing the molecular mechanism underlying the lissencephaly type I (4-7). Three of these articles refer to the participation of two ?recently? identified Nude mammalian homologues, as additional members of the Lis1/dynein/dynactin pathway. However, these so-called ?novel? proteins were, in fact, closely related or identical to the brain EOPA (3) showing at least 90% or more identity with EOPA. Support for the identity of EOPA and NudeL was also, independently, demonstrated by Sweeney et al. in 2001 (8).
        Following our complaint letter, the authors of the above mentioned articles apologized for the flagrant oversight with a feeble excuse regarding their unability to find our sequence in the GenBank databank by using blast at that time or arguing that differences in two amino acid residues in a protein of about 40 kDa was enough to argue that they were handling a completely new sequence. More precisely, Drs. Anthony Wynshaw-Boris and Shinji Hirotsune recognized to have negleted to reference the human homologue sequence we had deposited in GenBank a year before, while Drs. Li-Huei Tsai and Martin Niethammer apologized for the ?omission?, clarifying that the early version of the paper submitted to Neuron contained a reference to our previous publication, which was removed after the ?acceptance of the paper to Neuron? by unexplained reason. And finally, Dr. Olry Reiner, author of the minireview, recognized that our findings had not been discussed in the minireview and manuscripts, because he was not aware of our publication in BBRC. In summary, they all recognized our pionering work and apologized for their oversight, but it seems that none of them thought it should be relevant to evaluate the endooligopeptidase activity described since early 70s by our group for these so closely related proteins even after this incident and our testimony. Actually, it is clear that mNude described by Dr Chris A. Walsh and colleagues is in fact a product of a different gene (located on chromossome 16), while EOPA and NudeL, now named Ndel1, are the same protein encoded by a gene located on chromossome 17 in human, although both proteins share a high similarity in their protein primary sequence. On the other hand, the NudeL sequence described by Niethammer et al. (6) and deposited in Genbank under the accession No. AY004871 (June 1st, 2001), corresponds exactly to the sequence obtained by our group from a human brain cDNA library and registered more than one year earlier (Dec. 1st, 2000) in the same databank (Accession No. AF217798). However, since none of them were able to find or did not even evaluate the oligopeptidase activity of any of these proteins so far, we can understand that the name was ?limited? to the functional properties studied by them, at that time, should be of their choice and more suitable to avoid discussions on ?incomprehensible? biological features and functions of the protein, like the proteolytic activity we have been describing for so long.

        Later on, our group characterized the rabbit and human EOPA promoter showing a interestingly negative regulation of EOPA expression in non-neuronal cells, and furthermore that human EOPA shares 99.6% similarity with the rabbit brain EOPA (9). Moreover, the recombinant enzyme displays very similar proteolytic activity to the natural purified rabbit brain EOPA (3). More importantly, as published by us in 2005, the proteolytic activity of EOPA (named as NudeL by others and accepted by us too) involves the residue Cys273 (10), which was shown by us to be critical for neurite outgrow more recently (11). Surprisingly, the same Cys273 residue seems to be crutial for the regulation of the cytoplasmatic dynein activity (12). However, this later article published by O. Reiner and colleagues completely ignored again our previous contributions describing the importance of this residue for the catalytical activity of EOPA (10). It seems that once more, the scientific and ethical misconduct has been repeated now (12), in spite of the letter addressed to Orly Reiner in 2001, reminding the authors that the same protein had been previously described by our group (3).
        Intellectual property rights concerning the use of the catalytic property of EOPA involving residue Cys273 of EOPA/NUDEL for pharmaceutical applications was first filed in 2002 (INPI0205000-5). We wonder what legal rights and ethical rules could justify a complete lack of respect for the work performed by scientific colleagues who had first described the molecule and its properties, as happened once in 2000 (4), and recently again exactly 10 years later (12).

        In this context, I will transcribe next some fragments from the book ?Jeff?s view on science and scientists?, published by Elsevier in 2006 (13), in which it is described that the French word ?chauvinism? eternizes the inflated patriotism of Nicolas Chauvin of Rochefort, who was a Napoleon?s soldier [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Chauvin]. It remarks that chauvinism is actually not far behind from racism. And in the same way as me, Dr Schatz says that in his youth idealism he thought science would allow him to work together with people from different cultures far above individual interests, politics, languages, religions and nations. Later on, he has seen, however, that chauvinism is present everywhere, although scientific chauvinism is often subconscious and it is tricky to prove. The tendency to ignore the work done in other countries by a citation bias is a particularly subtle form of chauvinism, which existence is still not generally accepted (13). He also remarks that Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, in his masterpiece ?The Little Prince?, also featured a Turkish astronomer discovery of a new asteroid that was ignored by the international audience. According to the book, the asteroid was sighted by a Turkish astronomer in 1909 who had then made a formal demonstration to the International Astronomical Congress. "No one had believed him on account of the way he was dressed." Then, he and his people dressed like Europeans and went again to present the same asteroid to the International Astronomical Congress, and then they fully believed him and this time credited him with the work (14). Despite of that, I still do believe on true scientists who are really interested on innovation and on removing mental blinkers, giving to our mind a much bigger playground, instead of being merely hooked by the research funding system and its questionable numbers, based on citation frequencies, impact factors, grant scores and university rankings as brought to discussion by the last special issue of Nature (15).

        Hopefully, one day, the innovation in science will also require a proper description of the ?state of art? of the knowledge on the area, with the respective citations, before anyone can claim to be the first to describe any ?novel? molecule and/or pathway, as currently demanded by the regulations for intelectual property rights.

Editor's summary

Scientists today are accustomed to having their performance assessed by numerical yardsticks. 'Science metrics' took off with the introduction of Science Citation Index in the 1960s, and many new methods of assessment have been tried since. But are metrics as widely used as those being measured seem to think? A Nature readers' poll and survey of institutions around the world reveals a complicated picture. Many researchers feel that institutions put too much faith in 'suspect' metrics, though many administrators suggest that traditional methods such as personal recommendation generally trump the numerical indicators. Not all metrics tests are the same, however, and if they get better perhaps they should replace the old ways. Richard Van Noorden reports on the plethora of techniques now available, and on the thorny question of what, exactly, they measure. And in an Opinion piece, we canvass the opinions of six researchers as to how metrics methodology can be improved. See also the Editorial and online at http://www.nature.com/metrics .
