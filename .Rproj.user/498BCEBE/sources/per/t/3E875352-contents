## Academic service

In addition to research and teaching, I engage in applied academic work in collaboration with public institutions, funding agencies, and research organisations. This work focuses on research evaluation, bibliometrics, and science policy, and typically involves methodological design, analytical reports, and expert advice grounded in responsible and context-sensitive use of indicators.

**Areas of expertise**

- Bibliometric and scientometric analyses
- Design and assessment of research evaluation frameworks
- Analysis of scientific collaboration, careers, and research trajectories
- Methodological advice on data sources, indicators, and responsible metrics

**Selected institutional collaborations**

- Bibliometric analyses and reports for **Fulbright Spain** or **EC3Metrics** among others
- Research evaluation and assessment activities for public entities such as **European Commission**, the **US National Science Foundation**, the **Swiss National Science Foundation** or the **Spanish Agencia Estatal de Investigación**.
- Advisory work for the **International Centre for the Study of Research**

If you are interested in collaboration or applied academic work related to research evaluation, bibliometrics, or science policy, feel free to get in touch.
