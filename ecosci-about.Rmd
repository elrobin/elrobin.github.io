## The project

The ECOSCI project focuses on how scientists collaborate with each other and engage with society. The main goal is to deepen our understanding on what is expected of a scientist and how they distribute different tasks and organized their work. The purpose of the project is to surpass current evaluation schemes which consider research careers as homogeneous and explore novel and more nuanced ways in which research performance can be assessed. For this, we propose a valuation model (still under development) conformed of three main pillars:

1. **Evaluative dimensions.** We consider five dimensions as key factors to value the research performance of individuals. These are the following: 1) scientific engagement, 2) social engagement, 3) capacity building, 4) trajectory, and 5) open practices.

2. **Personal features.** These are characteristics of special interest for policy makers which in some cases may even individuals’ opportunity to perform such as language, gender, nationality or ethnicity.

3. **External factors.** Here confounding effects derived form individuals’ context such as work environment, institutional logics or national policies are considered.
